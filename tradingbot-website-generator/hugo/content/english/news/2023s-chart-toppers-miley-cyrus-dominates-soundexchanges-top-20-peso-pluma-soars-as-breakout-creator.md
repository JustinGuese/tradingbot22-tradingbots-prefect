# SoundExchange Releases Top 20 Lists Of 2023

WASHINGTON, Jan. 8, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- SoundExchange, the premier music tech organization powering the future of music, is kicking off the new year with a look back at 2023's Top 20 Tracks and Breakout Creators. The lists are based on 12 months (December 1, 2022 - November 30, 2023) of non-interactive streaming data from more than 3,600 digital service providers who operate under statutory license for which SoundExchange collects and distributes royalties.

Miley Cyrus' song "Flowers" holds the No. 1 spot on the Top Tracks of 2023 list, which comprises only current songs (released in 2022 and 2023). "Flowers" is followed by SZA's "Kill Bill" and Beyonc√©'s "Cuff It." SZA is one of three creators who has two songs on the list, with "Snooze" taking the No. 13 spot. The other artists doubling up are Taylor Swift with "Anti-Hero" (No. 5) and "Lavender Haze" (No. 18) and Luke Combs with his cover of Tracy Chapman's "Fast Car" (No. 9) and "Going, Going, Gone" (No. 20).

SoundExchange's Top 20 Breakout Creators list is made up of artists who gained traction for their music and talent in 2023. This data-based set reflects these creators' first significant streaming activity, fueled by strong debuts or career highlight releases that connected with wider audiences.
