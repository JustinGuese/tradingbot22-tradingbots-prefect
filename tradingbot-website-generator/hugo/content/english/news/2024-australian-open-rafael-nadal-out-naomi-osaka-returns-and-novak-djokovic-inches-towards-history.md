# 2024 Australian Open: Rafael Nadal misses out, Naomi Osaka returns, and Novak Djokovic on the edge of history

This year’s Australian Open is set to showcase some exciting comebacks and potential history-making moments. While some returning stars won't be able to compete, tennis fans can still look forward to the return of Naomi Osaka and Emma Raducanu. 

One notable absence from the tournament will be Rafael Nadal. The Spanish player's hopes of returning to grand slam tennis were dashed due to another injury suffered during a warm-up event in Brisbane. Nadal's absence will be felt by fans who were hoping to see him in action after almost a year out of the sport.

Meanwhile, Naomi Osaka and Emma Raducanu will be making their long-awaited returns to the big stage. Raducanu's 2023 season was plagued by injuries, and she only competed in one of the four grand slam events. Osaka took a break from tennis to focus on her mental health and became a mother in July 2023. Both players are expected to feature in this unpredictable tournament at Melbourne Park.

The Australian Open will begin on January 14 and run for 15 days until January 28. To accommodate players and fans, an extra day has been added to the schedule. This decision comes after calls to reduce finish times and alleviate the physical strain on players. Fans around the world can watch the action on platforms like Discovery+, Eurosport, and ESPN in the US.

In the men's draw, all eyes will be on Novak Djokovic. The Serbian player needs one more grand slam singles title to break the all-time record of 24 titles, currently held by Margaret Court. Djokovic had a phenomenal 2023 season, winning three of the four grand slams and the ATP Finals title. However, he suffered a slight wrist injury in the build-up to the Australian Open. Despite this setback, Djokovic remains focused on clinching his 11th Australian Open title.

The men's draw also features promising young talent, such as Carlos Alcaraz and Italian Jannik Sinner, who ended Djokovic's 19-match winning streak at the ATP Finals last year. American players Frances Tiafoe and Ben Shelton have also shown potential at previous grand slam events.

In the women's draw, the tournament is wide open. Naomi Osaka's return will add excitement to the women's game, although her title run may be challenging considering she is only two matches into her comeback. Former grand slam champions Angelique Kerber and Caroline Wozniacki will also compete, having taken breaks from the sport. Emma Raducanu, the 2021 US Open champion, aims to recapture her winning form.

Current world No. 1 Iga Świątek is considered a strong contender for the title. However, she faces a tough first-round match against 2020 winner Sophia Kenin. Aryna Sabalenka, the defending champion, and Coco Gauff, who won her maiden grand slam at the 2023 US Open, are also expected to make their mark in the tournament.

Players at this year's Australian Open will compete for a record-breaking prize purse of over $58 million. The winners of the men's and women's singles tournaments will earn over $2.1 million each. The prize money for the tournament has more than quadrupled over the past two decades.

As the 2024 Australian Open approaches, tennis fans are eagerly awaiting the return of some of their favorite players and the potential for history-making moments. With Nadal's absence, all eyes are on Djokovic as he seeks to solidify his place in tennis history. In the women's draw, the competition is wide open, making for an exciting and unpredictable tournament at Melbourne Park.
