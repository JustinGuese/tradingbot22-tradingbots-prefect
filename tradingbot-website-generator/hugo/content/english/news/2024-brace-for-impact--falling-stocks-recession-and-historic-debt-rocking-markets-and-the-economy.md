# Falling stocks, recession, and historic debt: Here's the bear case for markets and the economy in 2024

As we enter 2024, Wall Street may be feeling optimistic about the markets and the economy, but there are still concerns and risks that could weigh them down. Despite record-high S&P 500 year-end targets and soft-landing calls, the bear case for markets and the economy remains a possibility.

One major downside risk is the potential for a recession surprise. While the Federal Reserve has implemented restrictive policies, the effects may not have fully materialized yet. This leaves room for economic instability and a wobbling stock market if earnings disappoint.

Stubborn inflation is another concern. Recent data showed that consumer prices unexpectedly rose to 3.4% year-over-year in December, complicating the outlook for Fed policy and dampening expectations for rate cuts. Morningstar chief economist Preston Caldwell argues that a recession caused by the Fed would be a mistake that could be swiftly corrected by rapid and deep rate cuts. However, if the economy feels the full impact of previous rate hikes, hiring could slow down, unemployment could rise, and consumption could decline.

Historical data indicates that stock market returns are mixed during a recession. Positive returns were seen in about half of the 31 recessions that have occurred in the US since the Civil War. It's important to note that the stock market's recent performance has been heavily influenced by a few mega-cap stocks. Any significant dip in those names could result in a significant downturn for the broader market.

Both household and government debt are raising concerns. Americans have depleted their savings from the pandemic, and there are signs of a spending slowdown. Credit card delinquencies are on the rise, saving rates are declining, and consumer confidence remains tepid. Reductions in retail hiring during the holiday season also suggest that businesses are becoming more cautious. Additionally, the government's historic accumulation of debt is working against them. Buyers of US government debt may demand higher rates due to the lack of a concrete plan to reduce the debt. These higher long-term rates can slow the economy and potentially lead to a recession.

Geopolitical risks further add to the bear case. Ongoing conflicts between Russia and Ukraine, as well as Israel and Hamas, could escalate and disrupt global supply chains. Tensions between China and the US, particularly regarding Taiwan, could lead to further geopolitical turmoil. A military move by China could trigger a US response and potentially lead to a global conflict. These circumstances would add more stress to an already heavily leveraged US balance sheet and further increase the risk of a recession.

In addition, disruptions in the Red Sea could reignite global inflation. The Suez Canal is a critical trade route, and any interruptions to energy flows could contribute to inflationary pressures.

While there is optimism in the markets, it's important to consider the potential risks and uncertainties that could impact the economy in 2024. Investors should remain cautious and closely monitor these factors to make informed decisions.
