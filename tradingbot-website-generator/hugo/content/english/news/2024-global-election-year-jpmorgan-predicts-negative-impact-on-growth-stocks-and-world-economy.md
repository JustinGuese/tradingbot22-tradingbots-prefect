# JPMorgan: 2024 Will be the Biggest Global Election Year in History, Impacting Economy and Growth Stocks

JPMorgan has stated that 2024 will be the largest global election year ever, with several highly populous countries holding elections. However, strategists have warned that the results may have negative implications for the global economy and growth stocks.

According to JPMorgan, the upcoming elections could lead to four major trends: polarization, populism, democratic deterioration, and geo-economic fragmentation. These trends have the potential to negatively impact global growth and depress growth stocks in favor of value stocks.

One of the key elections to watch is that of the United States, where President Joe Biden is expected to face off against former President Donald Trump. JPMorgan believes that a victory by Trump could have broader macro implications, including the reversal of many of Biden's policies through executive orders.

The bank also warns of the potential impact of populist regimes, which often promote massive policy changes that can lead to short-term inflationary pressures. These regimes may also result in more borrowing and restricted trade, which could negatively affect global growth.

Uncertainty surrounding the elections, both in the US and other countries, is expected to generate higher market volatility. JPMorgan's strategists have found that S&P 500 volatility tends to be higher in US election years compared to non-election years.

Another important trend to watch is the continued erosion of democracy metrics, which have consequences for financial markets. JPMorgan cites surveys that show a decline in democracy and global freedom over the past 17 years. Weaker governance has been linked to higher market volatility and lower equity returns.

Overall, JPMorgan predicts that the 2024 elections will eventually have a negative impact on global growth and growth stocks. The bank advises investors to position themselves for election uncertainty and the return of populism by seeking higher risk premia and higher market volatility.

While the upcoming elections present opportunities for political change and the potential for economic shifts, investors should be cautious and prepared for potential market volatility and shifts in investment strategies.
