**3 Big New Catalysts for Psychedelics Stocks in 2024**

Psychedelics stocks could be buoyed by a few positive events soon. The government is now funding the study of certain psychedelics. Regulators could approve a new psychedelic medicine before 2025.

This could be the year that psychedelics stocks start to fly. Since mid-2021, biotech companies developing medicines based on psychoactive molecules like LSD and psilocybin (more commonly referred to as psychedelics) have had a rough go. Stocks of most of the segment's leaders are down more than 75% compared to three years ago, and for a time, funding for early-stage businesses looked like it was drying up. 2024 is going to be different. In fact, there's reason to believe that investors should prepare for takeoff, and also that there are opportunities in store for those who are comfortable taking significant risks with their money. Let's analyze what's going to happen and what it means.

Progress means risks are falling. In late 2023, three important developments set the stage for 2024 to be a wild year in the psychedelics industry. Two of those pertain to treating post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) using psychedelic medicine in conjunction with psychological support provided by a trained practitioner. Approximately 13 million people in the U.S. suffer from PTSD to some degree, and many don't get sufficient relief from the existing set of interventions, so it's a common indication for the psychedelics businesses to target, as the market is likely to be large.

On Dec. 19, Compass Pathways (CMPS) said that its candidate, COMP360, which features therapy with psilocybin with concomitant psychological support, had been well tolerated for the first 24 hours after treatment in a phase 2 clinical trial including 22 patients. Compass will give another update on the trial in the spring after a 12-week observation period elapses. If the results are favorable, it'll be a boost to the company's share price, and it'll help to address any lingering concerns about the safety of using certain psychedelic drugs to treat PTSD.

Compass also plans to report some data from one of its phase 3 trials testing COMP360 for treatment-resistant depression (TRD) sometime in the summer. TRD is actually COMP360's flagship indication, and, much like PTSD, the stakes are high. Getting a confirmation that its lead program is working as intended as it inches closer to submission to regulators for approval could be another significant catalyst for the biotech, as well as for many of its peers with earlier-stage programs. Investors should note that Atai Life Sciences (ATAI) is particularly exposed to potential upside as well as downside, as it has an equity investment in Compass, as well as its own psychedelic therapy programs for TRD and PTSD.

The biggest breakthrough thus far could be right around the corner. Aside from the pair of possible industry-wide catalysts that Compass Pathways is cooking up, there's an even larger one in the works. The nonprofit Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies (MAPS) Public Benefit Corp. reported on Dec. 12 that it had submitted paperwork to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) petitioning for the approval of its combination of MDMA and psychotherapy to treat PTSD. Many people are familiar with MDMA by its many
