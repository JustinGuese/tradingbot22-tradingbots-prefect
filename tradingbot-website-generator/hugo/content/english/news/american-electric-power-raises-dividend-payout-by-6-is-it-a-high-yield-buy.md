## summary

# American Electric Power Raises Dividend by 6%, Promising Future Growth

American Electric Power (AEP) recently announced a dividend increase of $0.05 per share, raising its quarterly dividend from $0.83 to $0.88. This 6% hike is in line with AEP's promise to match its dividend growth to its earnings growth. The utility company, which offers investors a 4.1% dividend yield, aims to grow its earnings by 6% annually.

While a 4.1% dividend yield may not be as high as a certificate of deposit (CD), AEP's ability to increase its dividend makes it an attractive option for income-seeking investors. The recent 6% dividend hike outpaces historical inflation rates, adding to the buying power of the dividend over time.

Compared to the average utility, AEP's dividend yield of 4.1% is higher than the 3.5% average. This represents a 14% increase in income for dividend investors who choose AEP. Despite the regulated nature of the utility industry, AEP is leveraging clean energy to fuel its long-term growth. The company plans to achieve net-zero emissions by 2045 and has shifted its focus to building solar and wind power projects.

The strategy of investing in regulated clean energy assets ensures guaranteed returns and facilitates the approval of customer rate increases by regulators. This transition to cleaner energy sources provides a foundation for AEP's projected earnings growth of 6% to 7% in the foreseeable future.

For dividend investors, AEP offers a reliable and safe option. The current dividend yield is at the higher end of the stock's 10-year range, making it an attractive time to consider investing in AEP. With its commitment to grow the dividend in line with earnings growth, AEP presents an opportunity for income-seeking investors to build a solid foundation for a diversified portfolio.
