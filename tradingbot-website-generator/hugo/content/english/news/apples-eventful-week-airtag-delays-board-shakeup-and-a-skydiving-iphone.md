# Appleverse In News This Week: AirTag Delays, Board Shake-Up, And A Skydiving iPhone

This week was full of developments for the tech giant Apple Inc. (AAPL), with news ranging from product delays and board changes to security concerns and even a skydiving iPhone. Let's dive into the highlights of Apple's busy week.

**AirTag's Next-Gen Launch Delayed**

The launch of Apple's highly anticipated second-generation AirTag has been pushed back from 2024 to 2025. The company has decided to delay the release due to an excess of the original AirTag product. Apple believes there is no rush to introduce the new AirTags since the first-generation device has been performing effectively and faces little competition in the "Find My" network.

**Major Changes in Apple's Board**

On Thursday, Apple announced the retirement of two board members, Al Gore and James Bell. Both board members have reached the company's age limit of 75. Al Gore has been a member of Apple's board since 2003, and James Bell joined in 2015. As replacements, Apple has proposed Wanda Austin, former CEO of The Aerospace Corporation, as a new board nominee.

**Security Concerns Over Apple's AirDrop**

The Chinese government has claimed to have cracked Apple's AirDrop, raising concerns over user security. A research institute in Beijing alleges to have decrypted the device log of an iPhone, which revealed phone numbers and email addresses linked to AirDrop users. The city's judicial bureau claims to have identified several suspects using this method.

**An iPhone's 16,000-feet Drop**

In a remarkable incident, an iPhone survived a 16,000-foot fall from an airplane and remained intact. The incident occurred on Alaska Air Group, Inc.'s (ALK) Flight 1282, where the phone unintentionally took a skydiving adventure. Despite the high-altitude plunge, the iPhone managed to survive unscathed.

**ITC Opposes Apple's Plea**

The U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) has declined Apple's request to suspend an import ban on specific Apple Watch models. The ITC described Apple's arguments as "weak and unconvincing" and dismissed the company's claim of irreparable harm caused by the ban as speculative.

These developments in the Appleverse have certainly captured the attention of tech enthusiasts and investors alike. Apple continues to navigate through various challenges, but its brand resilience and innovative products keep it in the spotlight.
