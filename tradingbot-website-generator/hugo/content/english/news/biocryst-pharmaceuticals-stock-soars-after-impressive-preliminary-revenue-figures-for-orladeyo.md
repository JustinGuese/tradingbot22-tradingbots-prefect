# BioCryst Pharmaceuticals Sees Increase in Stock Price Following Revenue Announcement

*January 8, 2024 - BioCryst Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (BCRX) shares are trading higher on Monday as the company released preliminary net revenue figures for its drug Orladeyo (berotralstat).*

BioCryst announced its preliminary, unaudited net revenue for Orladeyo, which amounted to $89.9 million for the fourth quarter of 2023 and a total of $325 million for the full year. The company also provided its projected global net Orladeyo revenue for 2024, expecting it to be between $380 million and $400 million.

CEO of BioCryst, Jon Stonehouse, expressed confidence in the continued growth of Orladeyo, stating, "After three years on the market, Orladeyo continues on a steady growth trajectory to achieve $1 billion at peak. This commercial success, alongside our proven discovery platform that is producing additional first-in-class or best-in-class molecules, uniquely positions BioCryst to achieve financial independence from the capital markets and accelerate our path to profitability."

Following the revenue announcement, Needham analyst Serge Belanger reiterated a Buy rating for BioCryst Pharmaceuticals and maintained a price target of $12. Belanger emphasized the company's potential profitability by 2025 without requiring additional capital and noted their interest in seeking partnerships for their BCX10013 program.

As a result of the positive revenue figures and the reaffirmed analyst rating, BioCryst Pharmaceuticals shares have surged 19% to $7.27 at the time of publication.

BioCryst Pharmaceuticals is a biotechnology company focused on the development and commercialization of treatments for rare diseases. Orladeyo, its flagship drug, is indicated for the prevention of hereditary angioedema attacks in adults and pediatric patients.
