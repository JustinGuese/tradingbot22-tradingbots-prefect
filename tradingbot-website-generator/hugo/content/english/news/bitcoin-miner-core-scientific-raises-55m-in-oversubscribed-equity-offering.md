## summary

# Bitcoin miner Core Scientific completes $55M equity offering

Bitcoin miner Core Scientific has successfully closed a $55 million equity financing round, which was oversubscribed. The company plans to return excess capital to investors. Core Scientific's CEO, Adam Sullivan, stated that the raise and repayment of previous financing positions the company for a strong emergence from Chapter 11 in January.

In its most recent financial statement from November 2023, Core Scientific reported $2.3 billion in assets, $559 million in liabilities, and total equity of $1.8 billion. The company intends to relist on the Nasdaq exchange once bankruptcy proceedings are concluded.

Core Scientific filed for bankruptcy in December 2022, citing factors such as the crypto winter, energy price increases, mining difficulties, and bad debt lent to crypto firm Celsius. Under its restructuring plan, the company would emerge with $709 million in net debt and $791 million in equity for shareholders.

The company's shareholders will receive new shares at a ratio of 25:1, providing them with $1.08 per pre-exchange share. Noteholders will receive $1.628 per face value for convertible notes due in April and $1.201 per face value for notes due in August.

Core Scientific recently announced that it had prepaid its outstanding debt-in-possession (DIP) balance provided by B. Riley Financial, amounting to $35 million. The company still has access to $35 million in available funding under the DIP agreement.

This latest equity offering and successful raise are expected to enhance Core Scientific's liquidity and support its growth plans as it continues operations in the Bitcoin mining industry.
