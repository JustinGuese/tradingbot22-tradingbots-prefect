## summary

# Bitcoin Could Hit $100,000, says CoinShare's Chief Strategy Officer

Meltem Demirors, the Chief Strategy Officer at CoinShare, has made a prediction that the price of Bitcoin (BTC/USD) could reach $100,000 in the near future. This forecast is based on the expectation of potential inflows of up to $100 billion following the approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF.

In an interview with CNBC, Demirors expressed her excitement about the new opportunities that the approval of Bitcoin ETFs brings for investors. She stated that the ability to easily access Bitcoin through a cost-efficient vehicle that can be traded in a brokerage account will attract a larger pool of funds into the cryptocurrency market.

Demirors believes that even a small allocation from retirement accounts in the U.S., which is a $34 trillion market, could result in a significant uptick in assets under management in Bitcoin. She stated, "if even 0.5% of that gets allocated over the first two years into Bitcoin, that's a huge uptick from current assets under management."

The approval of Bitcoin ETFs is seen as a game-changer in the traditional investment space. Demirors suggests that this new investment opportunity could change the dynamics of investment portfolios, where investors typically allocate their funds between fixed income assets and equities. She predicts that the approval of the ETFs could result in material flows of $25 to $100 billion in the first year alone.

Demirors' prediction aligns with the sentiments of analysts at investment bank Goldman Sachs, who have recognized the benefits of Bitcoin ETFs. These benefits include investor protection, better liquidity compared to Bitcoin access through private funds, and improved accessibility for investors.

The launch of Bitcoin ETFs has already generated significant trading volume, with $4.5 billion in trading volumes observed on the first day after approval. This trading volume was contributed by the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust and BlackRock Inc.

If Demirors' prediction holds true, the price of Bitcoin could surpass $100,000 by the end of the year, further solidifying its position as the king of cryptocurrencies.
