## summary

# The World's Top Cryptocurrency Had a Rough Week

After a year of impressive gains, the world's top cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, experienced a challenging week. Bitcoin, which had soared about 160% in 2023, saw a significant drop in its price, falling about 65% in 2022. As of writing, Bitcoin's price sits at around $43,700, but there is speculation that it could reach $100,000 by the end of 2024.

Bitcoin bulls are eagerly awaiting the approval of spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Major asset managers such as BlackRock and Fidelity have filed applications with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to bring these products to the market. If approved, spot ETFs would provide a stamp of approval for Bitcoin and potentially attract fresh capital, increasing demand and lifting the price.

In addition to the potential ETF approval, macro factors could also support Bitcoin's upward trajectory. With inflation showing signs of cooling, Federal Reserve officials might consider cutting interest rates multiple times in 2024. A looser monetary policy generally favors riskier assets like Bitcoin.

One of the most anticipated catalysts for Bitcoin's growth is the upcoming halving event, expected to occur in late April. The halving event, which happens approximately every four years, reduces the supply of new Bitcoin entering the market. In the past, this supply shortage combined with rising demand has been extremely bullish for Bitcoin.

Despite the potential for Bitcoin's price to reach new heights, investors should approach this volatile asset with caution. Bitcoin's price volatility may be too much for some investors to handle, especially those nearing retirement. For those considering investing, it is prudent to start with an amount that one is willing to lose, especially for those unfamiliar with Bitcoin. As knowledge and conviction increase, investors can consider increasing their allocation but always maintaining a long-term time horizon.

While a $100,000 price target for Bitcoin in 2024 is within the realm of possibility, it is not guaranteed. Investors should remain optimistic but also understand that things don't always go according to plan in the volatile cryptocurrency market. As with any investment, thorough research and careful consideration are essential.
