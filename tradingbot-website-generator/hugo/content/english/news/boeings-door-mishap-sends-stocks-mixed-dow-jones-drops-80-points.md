# U.S. Stocks Mixed as Dow Jones Drops 80 Points on Boeing Incident

The U.S. stock market experienced mixed trading on Monday, with the Dow Jones index falling approximately 80 points. Shares of The Boeing Company (BA) were particularly affected by a recent incident involving one of its aircraft. During a commercial flight, an exit door blew out of a 737 plane, leading to concerns about passenger safety.
