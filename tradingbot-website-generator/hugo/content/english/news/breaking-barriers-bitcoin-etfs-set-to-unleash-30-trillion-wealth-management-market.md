# Wealth Managers Get Access to Bitcoin Through New ETFs

Wealth managers who have long been locked out of the cryptocurrency market are finally able to gain exposure to Bitcoin through a new crop of approved Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs). The approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs has opened the doors for many large wealth managers to access the primary digital currency. Analysts at Standard Chartered anticipate that fund inflows in the range of $50 billion to $100 billion could be seen in 2024 as a result.

According to Anthony Pompliano, founder of Pomp Investments, Bitcoin is starting to become a benchmark asset for the younger generation. With most investors unable to beat benchmarks, adding Bitcoin to their asset allocation is seen as a way to try to keep up. The price of Bitcoin reached levels not seen since December 2021, rising to $49,000 before dropping to around $43,000 on Friday. This comes after a 150% rally in 2023.

Many wealth managers had previously been told not to touch crypto due to its unregulated nature. However, with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) recently clearing the sales of spot Bitcoin ETFs, investors can now access Bitcoin in the same way they purchase stock and bond index funds. Despite stern warnings from the SEC Chair, Gary Gensler, the approval of Bitcoin ETFs has sparked activity in the market.

Bitwise Asset Management, one of the 11 issuers granted initial approval for a Bitcoin product, is primarily targeting financial advisors and family offices with its Bitwise Bitcoin ETF. Chief Investment Officer Matt Hougan stated that financial advisors are increasingly carving out an allocation of 1% to 5% for crypto. A survey conducted by Bitwise found that 88% of advisors interested in purchasing Bitcoin were waiting for the approval of a Bitcoin ETF.

The new Bitcoin ETFs offer a more legitimate and cost-effective way for retirement plans to increase their crypto allocation. Companies such as Galaxy Digital, WisdomTree, and Fidelity have all conducted research on the benefits of adding Bitcoin to investment portfolios. The ETFs are also expected to appeal to those with high-growth tech stock portfolios, as well as those looking to include a digital gold asset in commodity-based portfolios.

Overall, the approval of Bitcoin ETFs has opened up new opportunities for wealth managers to gain exposure to the digital currency. With significant fund inflows anticipated in the coming years, it is clear that Bitcoin is becoming a more mainstream asset class within the wealth management industry.
