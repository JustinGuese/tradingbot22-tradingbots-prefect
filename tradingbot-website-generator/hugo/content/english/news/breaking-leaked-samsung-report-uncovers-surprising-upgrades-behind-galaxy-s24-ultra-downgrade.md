# Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra Upgrades Revealed in Latest Leak

The highly anticipated launch of Samsung's Galaxy S24 series is just a few days away, but leaks are still trickling in, providing insights into the powerful upgrades behind the scenes. A recent report sheds light on the improvements made to the Galaxy S24 Ultra's camera hardware, helping to explain the expected changes. 

According to an unverified retail training document shared by Harshit Joshi, a trusted source, the upcoming flagship smartphone will outperform its predecessor, the Galaxy S23 Ultra, particularly when it comes to zoom photography. Despite a potential "downgrade" in zoom lens specifications, Samsung aims to deliver outstanding zoom quality with the Galaxy S24 Ultra.

In the Galaxy S24 Ultra, Samsung is set to replace the 10x telephoto camera found on the S23 Ultra with a higher-resolution but lower-magnification 5x version. Some concerns have been raised about this change, as it may affect the phone's ability to capture high-quality long-range zoom shots.

However, the leaked document reveals a section titled "Space Zoom," which promises excellent zoom quality at all ranges and optical quality zoom at magnifications of 2x, 3x, 5x, and most importantly, 10x. Samsung's renowned long-range Space Zoom digital feature will also be available on the Galaxy S24 Ultra, allowing users to zoom up to 100x.

This suggests that the transition from a 10x to a 5x optical zoom on the Galaxy S24 Ultra will not lead to a decrease in image quality. The report explains that Samsung achieves this by employing a higher-resolution sensor in the new 5x camera, along with improved image processing techniques.

Additionally, the Galaxy S24 Ultra is expected to enable multi-frame processing at all zoom levels, not just at 20x and higher as seen in the S23 Ultra. This enhancement will reduce noise and enhance detail across the entire zoom range, further enhanced by new AI-powered "super-resolution" algorithms.

Despite these advancements, Samsung will need to convince potential buyers that the shift from 10x telephoto to 5x will actually result in better photos. All details will be revealed at the official Galaxy Unpacked event on January 17.
