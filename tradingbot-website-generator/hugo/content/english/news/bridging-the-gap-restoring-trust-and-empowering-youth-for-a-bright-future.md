# Leaders Must Restore Trust with Young People to Address Global Challenges

*January 13, 2024*

Every day, decisions are made that shape the future of our communities, countries, and the planet. However, young people often find themselves excluded from these decision-making processes, resulting in a crisis of youth mistrust in others and the future. The World Economic Forum recognizes the importance of including young people in these discussions and is taking action to empower 50 young innovators and activists at the Annual Meeting in Davos, Switzerland.

The first step towards restoring trust with young people is to ensure that they have a meaningful voice in decision-making. By inviting these changemakers from diverse backgrounds and walks of life, the World Economic Forum aims to bring tangible solutions and inspiring calls to action to world leaders. These young leaders will advocate for the solutions needed to address pressing challenges and repair trust in the future and between generations.

One of the greatest crises of our time is the biodiversity and climate crises. To restore trust with the next generation, world leaders must rapidly reduce emissions, honor financial commitments, and transition towards clean energy. Young conservationist Ann Dumaliang emphasizes the need for governments, industries, and businesses to act with empathy, accountability, and urgency. Ahmed Slim Bouakez, an ecopreneur, stresses the importance of transparency in land and water management to avoid conflicts and foster collaborative solutions.

Advances in technology have transformed every aspect of our lives. However, there is still a significant digital divide, and young people recognize the need to address the challenges of emerging technologies. Kathy Liu, a digital sovereignty development manager, highlights the importance of developing digital literacy, sharing data openly, and safeguarding online security. These priorities will help rebuild trust with the next generation and ensure an open, free, and secure digital future.

The economic outlook for young people has been hindered by global recession and the ongoing pandemic. High youth unemployment rates and limited access to decent jobs and housing have resulted in a lack of economic progress. Hashim Alsharif Alzaabi, an entrepreneur, emphasizes the importance of continuous learning and adaptability to rebuild trust in talent and job markets. Other young leaders will focus on expanding economic access and job opportunities for the next generation.

Inclusive governance and cooperation are vital to rebuilding trust with young people. Despite half of the world's population being under the age of 30, only a small percentage of parliamentarians fall within this age group. Reed Shafer-Ray, the founder of a non-profit organization, advocates for reserving government and board seats for youth. Lynn Malkawi, founder of a social enterprise, emphasizes the importance of using technology to engage youth and foster open governance.

Today's challenges require the diverse perspectives, innovative thinking, and commitment of young minds. By including young people in decision-making processes and addressing their concerns, leaders can restore trust and work towards solutions to global challenges. The World Economic Forum recognizes the potential of young changemakers and is committed to creating positive change alongside them.
