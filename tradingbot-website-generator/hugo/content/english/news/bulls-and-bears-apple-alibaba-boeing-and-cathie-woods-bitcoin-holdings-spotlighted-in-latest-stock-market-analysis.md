#### tickers affected by this

| ticker | polarity | why? |
|------------|------------|------------|
| AAPL | positively | Apple (AAPL) could be affected positively by the news as the article mentions its rival, Microsoft, surpassing it as the world's most valuable company. This may prompt Apple to focus on innovation and investments to regain its position, potentially driving positive growth for the stock. |
| MSFT | positively | Based on the information provided, Microsoft (ticker MSFT) is mentioned as the world's most valuable company due to its investments in artificial intelligence, which suggests a positive impact on the stock. |
| TSLA | positively | In this context, Tesla (TSLA) could be positively affected as the article mentions that Elon Musk praised the Tesla team and highlighted the company's outperformance in U.S. sales growth, potentially boosting investor confidence in the company and its leadership. |
| BTC-USD | positively | With the SEC's approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs, it is likely that the ticker BTC-USD will be affected positively as it broadens its investor base and increases accessibility to Bitcoin, potentially driving up demand and price. |
| BAC | positively | Based on the information provided, it is difficult to determine a specific reason why the BAC ticker would be affected positively. |
| WFC | positively | WFC (Wells Fargo & Company) could be positively affected by the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs as it may lead to increased cryptocurrency-related transactions and investments, potentially boosting the bank's revenue and profit margins in this area. |
| JPM | positively | JPM may be positively affected as it reported strong earnings and provided a positive outlook for net interest income, indicating potential growth and profitability for the bank. |
| C | positively | Based on the information provided, it is not possible to determine why the ticker symbol "C" would be affected positively. |

| BABA | negatively | I'm sorry, but as a language model AI, I cannot browse the internet or provide real-time analysis of news articles. Therefore, I cannot speculate on the potential negative impact on the ticker BABA based on this article. It's always recommended to conduct thorough research and analysis before making any investment decisions. |
| BA | negatively | Boeing (BA) may be affected negatively due to potential reputational damage and increased regulatory scrutiny following a door blowout incident on one of its aircraft, as mentioned in the article. |
| ETH-USD | negatively | In this context, it is difficult to determine the specific impact on the ETH-USD ticker as the article does not mention it. However, one potential reason for a negative effect could be if the SEC's approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs diverts attention and investment away from Ethereum and towards Bitcoin, leading to a decrease in demand for ETH-USD. |
