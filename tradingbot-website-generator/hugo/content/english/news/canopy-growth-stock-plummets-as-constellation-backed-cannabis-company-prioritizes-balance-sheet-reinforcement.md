## summary

# Constellation-backed marijuana company continues moves to strengthen its balance sheet

Canopy Growth Corp., a marijuana company backed by Constellation Brands Inc., is taking steps to improve its financial position. The company's stock fell by 9.5% to $4.56 per share after announcing a private placement of $30 million in units with institutional investors. Canopy Growth has been making efforts to strengthen its balance sheet as it has yet to turn a profit.

The private placement was priced at $4.29 per unit, which is below the stock's closing price of $5.04 per share on Monday. The proceeds from the sale will be used to reduce the company's debt. Each unit consists of one common share and one warrant, which allows holders to purchase one common share at $4.83 per share.

Over the past year, Canopy Growth's stock has declined by 81%, while its Canadian rival Tilray Brands Inc. has seen a drop of 23.6%. The company's struggles to achieve profitability and the oversupply and overspending in the cannabis industry have raised concerns among analysts.

Despite the challenges, Canopy Growth remains supported by Constellation Brands, a major player in the liquor industry. The company's efforts to strengthen its balance sheet through the private placement demonstrate its commitment to improving its financial position and weathering the challenges in the cannabis market.

Investors will be closely watching Canopy Growth's progress as it continues to navigate the evolving cannabis industry and work towards profitability. With the backing of Constellation Brands, the company has the potential to rebound and capitalize on the growing demand for cannabis products.
