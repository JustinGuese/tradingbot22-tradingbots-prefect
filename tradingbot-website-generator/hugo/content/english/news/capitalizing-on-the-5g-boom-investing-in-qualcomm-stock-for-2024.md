# Why I'm Buying More Qualcomm Stock In 2024

*By Nicholas Rossolillo â€“ Jan 13, 2024*

Qualcomm, the wireless communications chip technologist, is poised to benefit from the increased use of 5G technology. Despite a decline in smartphone sales last year, Qualcomm's stock performed well, and it is expected to see another potential run higher in 2024.

With the smartphone market bottoming out and ongoing expansion of 5G networks, Qualcomm has the potential for strong performance in the year ahead. The company has remained highly profitable even during tough economic times.

During the first wave of 5G network launches in recent years, Qualcomm experienced a boom in revenue and earnings per share. However, with the drop in consumer electronics purchasing after the pandemic, the company faced a downturn. Nevertheless, 5G growth is far from over. The improvements in 5G networks require the sale of more chips, both in network infrastructure and smartphones. Additionally, other devices such as PCs, automobiles, and smart factories are envisioned as being 5G-capable. These developments around 5G bode well for Qualcomm.

According to Qualcomm's CFO, Akash Palkhiwala, a transition to more 5G chips could result in a 10% increase in semiconductor average selling price. Combined with a decrease in smartphone sales, Qualcomm could be entering a new phase of growth. The company's fourth-quarter fiscal 2023 revenue was $8.6 billion, and the outlook for the first quarter of fiscal 2024 is for revenue of $9.1 billion to $9.9 billion, potentially indicating year-over-year growth.

Despite the downturn in the smartphone and consumer electronics market, Qualcomm remained profitable. Its free cash flow has already returned to all-time highs, indicating a strong business recovery. As sales increase, Qualcomm's profit margins could rebound in 2024. The company has ample cash flow to fund research and development, service debt, pay dividends, and repurchase stock.

Qualcomm's stock is currently trading at a reasonable value, at around 15 to 16 times Wall Street analysts' consensus estimate for 2024 free cash flow. With the expected uptick in smartphone and 5G sales, it presents a promising investment opportunity. Nicholas Rossolillo, an investment professional, recently added to his position in Qualcomm and recommends holding it as a core semiconductor stock for 2024 and beyond.
