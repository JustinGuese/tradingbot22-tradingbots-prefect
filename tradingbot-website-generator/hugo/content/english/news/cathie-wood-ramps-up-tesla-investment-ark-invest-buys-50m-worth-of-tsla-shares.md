## summary

# Cathie Wood-run Ark Invest Increases Position in Tesla Amid Stock Decline

Cathie Wood's investment firm, Ark Invest, continued to show confidence in Tesla as it bulked up on the electric vehicle company's stock on Friday. Ark, through its Ark Innovation ETF (ARKK) and Ark Next Generation Internet ETF (ARKW), purchased 111,802 Tesla shares, valued at $24.47 million.

This is the second consecutive day that Ark has increased its position in Tesla. On Thursday, the firm added 112,475 shares worth $25.56 million. In total, Ark purchased approximately $50 million worth of Tesla shares this week.

Tesla is the second-highest holding in Ark's flagship exchange-traded fund, ARKK, with a weighting of 7.90%. It is also the top holding of the Ark Autonomous Technology & Robotics ETF (ARKQ), with an 11.98% weighting, and the sixth-highest holding of ARKW, with a 5.20% weighting.

Tesla's stock has been under pressure recently, with a decline of 11.91% in January amid a broader sell-off in the technology sector. The company's stock was further affected by a price cut announcement in China, which led investors to discount stable prices.

Analysts are closely watching Tesla's upcoming fourth-quarter earnings report, scheduled for January 24. They will be interested in the company's core auto gross margin and the 2024 deliveries guidance. Analysts currently estimate earnings of 67 cents per share, down from $1.19 per share a year ago, and a potential 4.70% decline in revenue to $23.17 billion.

Despite the recent decline in Tesla's stock, Ark Invest's continued buying suggests that the investment firm believes in the company's long-term growth prospects in the electric vehicle market.
