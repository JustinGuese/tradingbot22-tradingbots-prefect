# Citigroup to Cut 20,000 Jobs in Major Strategic Overhaul, Cites 'Disappointing' Q4

Citigroup Inc. (C) has announced plans to eliminate 20,000 jobs in a major restructuring effort aimed at improving the financial giant's performance. Spearheaded by CEO Jane Fraser, the decision comes in response to the bank's underwhelming fourth-quarter results. Citigroup expects the job cuts to result in significant savings, potentially reaching $2.5 billion.

As part of the overhaul, Citigroup projects a decrease in overall expenses, aiming for $51 billion to $53 billion by 2026. However, the bank anticipates up to $1 billion in costs this year, primarily due to severance and restructuring expenses. The restructuring announcement follows a challenging quarter for Citigroup, particularly in its fixed-income trading sector. The bank experienced a 25% drop in revenue in this area, amounting to $2.6 billion, largely due to a decline in client activity towards the end of the year.

CEO Jane Fraser expressed disappointment in the fourth-quarter results and stated that 2024 would be a turning point for the bank. Following the announcement of the restructuring, Citigroup's shares saw a rise of over 1.5% in New York, offsetting a previous 1.8% drop resulting from the bank's announcement of substantial one-time charges.

The job eliminations are set to begin the week of January 22 and are expected to be completed by the end of the first quarter. Fraser's restructuring plan aims to generate annual savings of $1 billion for Citigroup by eliminating 5,000 managerial positions. The bank's overall headcount is projected to decrease by 60,000, bringing it down to 180,000 by the end of 2026, including 40,000 employees following the IPO of its consumer banking businesses in Mexico.

Citigroup's fourth-quarter results revealed a loss of $1.8 billion, or $1.16 per share, due to various one-time charges. These charges included a $780 million severance expense related to the job cuts. The bank also recorded a $1.7 billion charge in operating expenses for the quarter, partly attributed to a special assessment to replenish the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.'s reserves.

This news may have implications for related stocks such as Bank of America Corp. and Wells Fargo & Co., as well as ETFs like the Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund and Vanguard Financials ETF.
