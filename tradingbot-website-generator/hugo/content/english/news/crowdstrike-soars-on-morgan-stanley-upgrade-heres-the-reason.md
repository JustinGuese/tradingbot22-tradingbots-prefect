# CrowdStrike Stock Is Ripping Higher Tuesday: Here's Why

**Morgan Stanley analyst Hamza Fodderwala upgrades CrowdStrike from Equal-Weight to Overweight.**

CrowdStrike Holdings Inc (CRWD) shares are trading higher Tuesday on the back of an upgrade from Morgan Stanley. Analyst Hamza Fodderwala upgraded CrowdStrike from an Equal-Weight rating to an Overweight rating and raised the price target from $203 to $304.

Fodderwala cited improving demand, platform traction, and upcoming AI product cycles as the reasons for the upgrade. He expects increased demand and traction to drive more meaningful upside to annual recurring revenue and free cash flow forecasts in 2024.

Despite CrowdStrike's significant outperformance over the last year, with shares rallying more than 185%, Fodderwala believes that the aforementioned catalysts will drive the stock higher throughout the year. 

Morgan Stanley's new price target of $304 assumes an EV/FCF multiple of 45, which is higher than the current multiple of 38. However, Fodderwala noted that CrowdStrike is still trading at a "slight discount" compared to its SaaS/cybersecurity peers.

When considering whether to buy a stock, investors should look at key fundamentals such as revenue growth and valuation. CrowdStrike has reported average annual revenue growth of 74.58% over the past 5 years and expects FY24 revenues of $3.04 billion. The company has a forward P/E ratio of 71.43, compared to the average forward P/E ratio of its peers at 58.64.

Other important metrics to consider include profitability, balance sheet strength, performance relative to benchmark indexes, and valuation compared to peers.

At the time of publication, CrowdStrike shares were up 5.15% at $274.85.
