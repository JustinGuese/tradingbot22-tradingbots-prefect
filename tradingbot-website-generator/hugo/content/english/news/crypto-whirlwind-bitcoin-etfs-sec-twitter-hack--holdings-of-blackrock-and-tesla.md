#### tickers affected by this

| ticker | polarity | why? |
|------------|------------|------------|
| BTC-USD | positively | The approval of Bitcoin ETFs by the SEC and the positive sentiment from industry figures like Anthony Scaramucci and Cathie Wood are likely to create increased awareness and demand for Bitcoin, leading to a positive impact on the BTC-USD ticker. |
| BLK | positively | The approval of Bitcoin ETFs can potentially lead to increased adoption of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology, benefiting companies like BlackRock, which is among the firms that have applied to establish BTC ETFs. This could open up new opportunities for BlackRock to offer crypto-related investment products and services. |

| SHIB-USD | negatively | The SHIB-USD ticker may be affected negatively as the increased burn rate of Shiba Inu tokens could potentially create scarcity, leading to a decrease in the overall supply and potentially driving up the price. |
| DOGE-USD | negatively | The ticker DOGE-USD may be affected negatively as the surge in Bitcoin's price and the approval of Bitcoin ETFs may draw attention away from Dogecoin, causing a decrease in demand and potential loss of investor interest. |

# Weekly Crypto Recap: Bitcoin ETFs, SEC Twitter Hack, and Holdings of Big Names

The past week was a rollercoaster ride in the world of cryptocurrencies, with high-profile industry figures sharing their crypto holdings and significant developments unfolding related to Bitcoin ETFs. Here’s a quick recap of the top stories that kept the crypto market buzzing.

**1. Scaramucci Hails Bitcoin ETF Approval**: Anthony Scaramucci, the Trump-era White House Communications Director and CEO of SkyBridge Capital, expressed his desire to be a ‘ceremonial buyer’ of Bitcoin ETFs after the SEC’s approval. The former communications director is bullish about Bitcoin’s future, predicting it could surpass its previous all-time high of $69,000 by next year.

**2. SEC Twitter Account Compromised**: The SEC confirmed that its official Twitter account was hacked, leading to a false announcement about Bitcoin ETF approvals. The tweet has since been retracted, and SEC Chair Gary Gensler clarified that no such approval had been granted.

**3. Musk Open to Bitcoin Use on X**: Elon Musk, in a conversation with Ark Invest CEO Cathie Wood, stated he’s open to the idea of using Bitcoin on X. The Tesla Inc. CEO did not dismiss the concept during an X Space event.

**4. Cathie Wood Shares Personal Bitcoin Holdings**: ARK Investment Management CEO Cathie Wood revealed for the first time that a significant portion of her personal net worth is invested in Bitcoin. She stated that her personal financial investments include both her firm's private funds and cryptocurrencies, primarily Bitcoin.

**5. Crypto Prices Surge Post Bitcoin ETF Approval**: Major cryptocurrencies witnessed a surge after U.S. regulators approved Bitcoin ETFs. Firms like BlackRock, Fidelity, and Grayscale are among the dozen companies that have applied to establish BTC ETFs. After the announcement, Bitcoin’s price surged past $47,500, leading to a rally in other altcoins.

**6. Shiba Inu Burn Rate Skyrockets**: The self-proclaimed ‘Dogecoin killer’ Shiba Inu saw its token burn rate increase by over 27,500% in 24 hours. Around 9 billion SHIB tokens were moved to a "dead wallet," effectively pulling these tokens out of circulation.

These developments have created significant buzz in the crypto market, with investors closely monitoring the implications and potential impact on the value of cryptocurrencies. As the crypto market continues to evolve, it is important for investors to stay informed and make well-informed decisions based on accurate and timely information.
