# Davos's party secrets: Caviar, magic mushrooms, champagne and A-list private concerts

Scores of private jets are set to touch down in Switzerland as the world's elite descend upon the Alpine resort town of Davos for the World Economic Forum 2024. This year, more than 3000 masters of the universe will gather for the 54th annual event, with the theme "Rebuilding Trust." 

Davos regulars describe the atmosphere as magical, with countless opportunities to network with some of the smartest people in the world. However, not all attendees are considered equal. The event operates with a caste system, where the importance of individuals is denoted by the color of their badge. White badges, reserved for the top-tier business leaders, represent the most prestigious accreditation.

The event attracts a range of high-profile attendees, including political heavyweights such as Chinese Premier Li Qiang, French president Emmanuel Macron, and U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken. CEOs and thought leaders from top companies, including JP Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, will also be vying for invitations to the best cocktail parties and private dinners.

While the event is known for its policy discussions, the real allure lies in the glamorous cocktail parties and private performances by world-famous artists such as Lenny Kravitz, Chris Martin of Coldplay, and the Black Eyed Peas. Attendees will have the chance to mingle with A-list celebrities and snap selfies with the stars.

Private dining experiences are another highlight of the event, with organizers aiming to attract top corporate guests. Notably, salesforce CEO Marc Benioff is known for hosting lavish dinners and is also an enthusiastic participant on the dance floor. Other private dinner organizers face the challenge of securing attendance from busy CEOs, with JP Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman among the sought-after guests this year.

Davos, however, isn't without its controversy. The specter of Jeffrey Epstein continues to haunt the event, with JP Morgan star banker Mary Erdoes, who dealt with Epstein after his conviction, expected to attend. Supermodel Naomi Campbell also has connections to Epstein, as she was mentioned in recently unsealed documents related to the disgraced financier.

Critics of Davos argue that the event is attended by the "metropolitan elites" who discuss how to make the world more businesslike while ignoring the issues faced by ordinary people. Despite the criticism, Davos remains a unique opportunity for networking, learning, and enjoying the extravagant parties and performances that come along with it.

While the concrete achievements of the event may be difficult to quantify, attendees continue to find value in the connections and knowledge gained from participating. As one longtime attendee remarked, "You never leave the mountain without learning something important or making a new friend."

The World Economic Forum 2024 in Davos will surely be a spectacle of wealth, power, and networking, as the world's elite gather for discussions and celebrations against the backdrop of the snowy Alpine resort town.
