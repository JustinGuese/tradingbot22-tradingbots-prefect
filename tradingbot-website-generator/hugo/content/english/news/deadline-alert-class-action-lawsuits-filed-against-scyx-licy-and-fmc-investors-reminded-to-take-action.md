**SCYNEXIS, Inc. (NASDAQ: SCYX)**

Class Period: March 31, 2023 – September 22, 2023
Lead Plaintiff Deadline: January 8, 2024

The class action lawsuit alleges that throughout the Class Period, SCYNEXIS made materially false and/or misleading statements, as well as failed to disclose material adverse facts about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects. It is alleged that the company failed to disclose the risk of cross-contamination in the manufacturing process of its drug substance and had inadequate internal controls and procedures. Due to the risk of cross-contamination, the company was reasonably likely to recall its tablets and halt its clinical studies. As a result, defendants' positive statements about the company were misleading.
