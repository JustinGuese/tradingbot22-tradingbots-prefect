# Rosen Law Firm Reminds Dollar General Corporation Investors of Lead Plaintiff Deadline in Securities Class Action Lawsuit

**New York, Jan. 13, 2024** - Rosen Law Firm, a global investor rights law firm, has reminded purchasers of common stock of Dollar General Corporation (NYSE: DG) about the upcoming lead plaintiff deadline in a securities class action lawsuit. The lawsuit alleges that Dollar General made false and misleading statements, resulting in investor losses.

Investors who purchased Dollar General common stock between May 28, 2020, and August 30, 2023, may be entitled to compensation. The lead plaintiff deadline is January 26, 2024. 

The lawsuit claims that Dollar General stores were chronically understaffed and faced logistical and inventory management problems. This led to tens of millions of dollars' worth of outdated and unwanted inventory, mispriced goods, and lost and damaged items. Additionally, the company allegedly overcharged customers for items upon checkout, violating state laws. As a result, the reported revenue and earnings of Dollar General were artificially inflated.
