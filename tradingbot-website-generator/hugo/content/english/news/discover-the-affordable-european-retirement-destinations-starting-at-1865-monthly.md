# Retirement in Europe: Affordable Options for American Retirees

Retirement isn't cheap, and it's getting more expensive every year, especially in the United States thanks to inflation and medical costs. The average American 65 and older spends $4,818 per month in the United States. On the other hand, the average social security check for 2024 is a mere $1,907. There's something wrong with that math.

However, if retirees are willing to look beyond U.S. borders, they can make their social security check stretch much farther. The misconception that the only places that significantly reduce the cost of living are in Latin America or Asia is false. Europe, too, offers affordable options for retirees looking for a more exciting and indulgent lifestyle.

Living and Invest Overseas has released its Overseas Retirement Index for 2024, which showcases the costs of living in various European destinations. Here are the top five picks for affordable European retirement:

### Valencia, Spain: $2,477 Per Month For A Couple

Valencia, known as the "City of Joy," boasts a rich history that spans 2,000 years. It offers a mix of medieval Islamic architecture and futuristic structures. The city enjoys warm Mediterranean beaches and approximately 2,700 hours of sunshine per year. Spain, in general, is known for being affordable, and Valencia is no exception, despite its high-level infrastructure and quality of life.

### Braga, Portugal: $2,855 Per Month For A Couple

Braga, the culturally vibrant capital of Portugal's northern Minho Province, offers lush green landscapes and famous vineyards. The city's historic center is filled with charming caf√©s, restaurants, churches, and more. Compared to more popular retirement destinations in Portugal like the Algarve, Lisbon, and Porto, Braga is significantly more affordable. The cost of living here is lower, and property prices haven't inflated as much.

### Crete, Greece: $1,865 Per Month For A Couple

Crete, the largest island in the Mediterranean, is a paradise for beach lovers and fans of archaeology. The island offers a variety of landscapes, from cities and mountain villages to snow-capped mountains and pristine beaches. Crete also boasts ski resorts and unique land formations for outdoor recreation. Surprisingly, the cost of living on the island is one of the lowest in Europe, making it an attractive option for retirees.

### Gascony, France: $1,952 Per Month For A Couple

Gascony, a picturesque region in France, resembles something out of a fairy tale. With its charming villages, pastoral landscapes, and traditional way of life, Gascony offers a peaceful retreat. The region's affordability comes from living like a local, making use of local markets that offer affordable goods and produce. Gascony proves that life in Europe is not financially out of reach for Americans.

### Kotor Bay, Montenegro: $2,658 Per Month For A Couple

Known as Europe's Secret Riviera, Kotor Bay in Montenegro offers stunning landscapes, medieval towns, and luxurious developments. The region boasts sparkling coastlines and breathtaking mountain vistas. Despite being a playground for the wealthy, the cost of living in Kotor Bay remains flexible, with options ranging from standard to luxury lifestyles. Compared to neighboring Croatia, Kotor Bay provides similar appeal at much more affordable prices.

Retirees looking to reduce the cost of living while increasing their quality of life have several affordable options in Europe. These destinations offer rich histories, beautiful landscapes, and a variety of recreational activities. For a detailed budget comparison and more information on each location, the full Overseas Retirement Index is available for reference.

As retirement becomes more expensive in the United States, exploring affordable options abroad can provide retirees with a comfortable and exciting lifestyle. By thinking outside the box and considering European destinations, retirees can make the most of their retirement savings and enjoy their golden years to the fullest.
