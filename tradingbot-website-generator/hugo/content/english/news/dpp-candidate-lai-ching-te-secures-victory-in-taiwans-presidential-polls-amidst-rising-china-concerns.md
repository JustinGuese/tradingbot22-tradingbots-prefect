# DPP Candidate Lai Ching-te Wins Taiwanese Presidential Polls Amid Tensions with China

Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) candidate Lai Ching-te has emerged victorious in the much-anticipated Taiwanese presidential polls, according to a report by Taiwan News. Lai's win marks the historic third-straight victory for the DPP after Tsai Ing-wen completed her two terms as Taiwan President since 2016.

With over 40 percent of the vote share, Lai received more than 5 million votes, as reported by the Central Election Commission. The counting was done from over 90 percent of polling stations as of 7:45 pm (local time).

The previously undecided voters split three ways among the candidates, giving Lai a seven-point lead over Kuomintang candidate Hou Yu-ih, who received 33 percent of the total votes. In third place, the Taiwan People's Party candidate Ko Wen-je took 26 percent of the national vote, performing marginally better than expected.

Lai, the former mayor of Tainan, has pledged to prioritize national defense, the economy, and cooperation with democratic allies. He has also committed to maintaining deterrence and upholding the cross-strait status quo. Lai's victory signifies a clear message from the Taiwanese people that they will not back down from Chinese intimidation.

However, Lai's win is expected to cause a protest from Beijing, which would have preferred the China-friendly Kuomintang (KMT) and Hou Yu-ih in power. China's Taiwan Affairs Office has already labeled Lai as an "obstinate Taiwan independence worker" who would bring "cross-strait confrontation and conflict."

China has been increasing military activities around Taiwan, including near-daily incursions into the country's air defense identification zone (ADIZ) and sending military ships near its maritime borders.

Lai's victory also coincided with the legislative elections, where Taiwanese voted for all 113 seats at the Legislative Yuan. The results for legislative seats were predicted to become apparent later than the presidential race.

The international community is closely watching Taiwan's elections, given the escalating tensions with China. Beijing's threats towards Taipei over the past eight years have raised concerns globally, and the world is awaiting not only the election results but also the response from Taiwan's "authoritarian neighbor."
