# Eos Energy Expands Collaboration with TETRA Technologies to Enhance Electrolyte Supply

Eos Energy Enterprises, Inc. (EOSE) has announced an expansion of its partnership with TETRA Technologies, Inc. (TTI) to further improve the quality of the electrolyte solution used in Eos's energy storage products. The two companies have been working together since 2021, and this expansion solidifies TETRA as the primary strategic supplier for Eos's American-made Eos Z3 energy storage cube.

Under the new agreement, TETRA will supply at least 75% of the electrolyte product needs for Eos moving forward. The four-year deal, which can be extended beyond its initial term, includes favorable pricing and cost-saving methodologies that incentivize both companies to pursue further cost reductions. TETRA's U.S. patented manufacturing process ensures high levels of zinc-bromide purity, a critical component of Eos's patented electrolyte system.

The timing of the expanded collaboration is significant, as the demand for Long Duration Energy Storage is increasing. Eos's partnership with TETRA will help meet this growing demand by scaling production, reducing costs, and enhancing battery performance and quality over the next few years. TETRA's commitment to improving bromine production aligns with Eos's goals.

In response to the news, EOSE shares are trading lower by 5.32% at $0.9450, while TTI is down by 1.61% at $4.27 on Tuesday.
