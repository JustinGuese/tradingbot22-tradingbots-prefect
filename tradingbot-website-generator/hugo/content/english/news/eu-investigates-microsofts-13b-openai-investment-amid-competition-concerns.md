## summary

# EU Eyes Microsoft's $13B OpenAI Investment for Potential Anti-Competitive Practices

The European Union (EU) is closely scrutinizing Microsoft Corp's $13 billion investment in OpenAI, raising concerns over potential anti-competitive practices in the field of artificial intelligence (AI). The EU, along with the UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), is reviewing the partnership between Microsoft and OpenAI, particularly in light of recent internal changes at ChatGPT's creator.

The European Commission and the UK's CMA are exploring the depth of Microsoft's involvement with OpenAI and its potential impact on fair competition in the rapidly growing AI and virtual worlds market. EU antitrust commissioner Margrethe Vestager emphasizes the importance of keeping new markets competitive and open for innovation.

Microsoft's integration of OpenAI's products across its businesses has quickly positioned it as a leading AI company, prompting rivals like Google to intensify their efforts in the sector. The partnership's scrutiny intensified after the firing and rehiring of Sam Altman as OpenAI's chief, revealing close ties between the two companies. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella was personally involved in negotiating Altman's return, highlighting the interconnectedness of Microsoft and OpenAI.

The EU's investigation also includes a call for feedback on competitive issues in AI and virtual worlds, reflecting the EU's growing interest in the sector's competitive dynamics and the significant venture capital investment in AI in Europe.

The UK's CMA is also examining Microsoft's partnership with OpenAI and considering launching a probe into their collaboration for potential competition issues. This evaluation follows the CMA's approval of Microsoft's acquisition of Activision Blizzard. Microsoft, as OpenAI's principal investor, has invested $13 billion in the AI startup, leading to OpenAI's integration into Microsoft's enterprise tools and reliance on Microsoft's cloud services.

The EU's scrutiny of Microsoft's investment in OpenAI comes at a crucial time as the EU is reportedly close to reaching an agreement that could result in extensive regulation of AI technologies, including ChatGPT and Google Bard. This marks a significant step in global AI policy.

Microsoft's stock gained 65% last year, outperforming the broader index Invesco QQQ Trust, Series 1. However, following the news of the EU's investigation, Microsoft shares traded lower by 0.16% at $374.10 on the last check Tuesday.
