## summary

# Electric Vehicle Stocks Fall for Second Straight Week

**January 13, 2024** - Electric vehicle (EV) stocks experienced another week of decline as risk aversion intensified on Wall Street. This comes after concerns arose that the Federal Reserve may delay rate hikes due to the December consumer price inflation report. Tesla, Inc. (TSLA), the market leader, saw a decline throughout the week, with the exception of one session. Here are the key events that occurred in the EV space during the week:

**Tesla's Model 3 Refresh Launch in North America, China Price Cuts**

Four-and-a-half months after Tesla introduced its updated Model 3 EV in China, the refreshed model made its way to North America. The dual-motor long-range and rear-wheel drive variants of the refreshed Model 3 are now available for sale. The former has an estimated EPA range of 341 miles and is priced at $38,990, while the RWD variant costs $45,990. In China, Tesla lowered the prices of its Model 3 electric vehicles by 2% to 5%, despite strong sales momentum. Analysts are estimating a $1 billion decrease in Tesla's 2024 earnings, or 25-30 cents per share, in response to these price cuts.

**Lucid's Q4 Production, Deliveries Decline Year-Over-Year**

Luxury EV maker Lucid Group, Inc. (LCID) experienced a decline in full-quarter production and deliveries. The company reported producing 8,428 units and delivering 6,001 units in the quarter, down from its previous estimates of 8,000 to 8,500 units. Fourth-quarter production and deliveries were 2,391 units and 1,734 units respectively, representing a decline from the year-ago figures.

**XPeng Showcases Flying Car**

Chinese EV startup XPeng, Inc. (XPEV) revealed its electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) flying car at the Consumer Electronics Show 2024. The company plans to open pre-order reservations for its modular flying car in China later this year.

**Canoo Acquires Manufacturing Assets at Discount**

Lifestyle EV maker Canoo, Inc. (GOEV) purchased manufacturing assets of an EV manufacturer at a significant discount. The acquired assets, including robotics and processing equipment, will be used to build vehicle cabins in Oklahoma.

**Honda Unveils '0' Series Concept EVs**

Japanese automaker Honda Motor Co. (HMC) introduced its "0" series EV concept models, the Saloon and Space-Hub, at the CES. These models feature a new design philosophy focused on sustainability and user experience. Honda hinted at a potential North American launch of these EVs in 2026.

Overall, the KraneShares Electric Vehicles and Future MobilityÂ Index ETF (KARS) fell 4.10% for the week, reflecting the broader decline in the EV sector.
