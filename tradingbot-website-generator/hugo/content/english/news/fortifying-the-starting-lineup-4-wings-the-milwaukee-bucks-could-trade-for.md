# Milwaukee Bucks Considering Trade for Defensive-Minded Wing to Strengthen Starting Lineup

*(Milwaukee, Wisconsin)* - In an ideal world, Milwaukee Bucks' general manager Jon Horst would weave his trade magic, securing a defensive-minded wing to fortify the starting lineup. Such an addition would be a dual fix, shoring up defensive struggles and elevating the bench unit by slotting the scorching Malik Beasley into the second unit.

However, the world seldom aligns perfectly with our dreams. Horst faces a considerable challenge navigating Milwaukee's sparse asset inventory leading up to the February 8th trade deadline. His bargaining chips are limited to the Portland Trail Blazers' 2024 second-round pick (likely in the low-to-mid 30s) and the Bucks' own 2027 second-rounder. Among promising prospects, MarJon Beauchamp and Andre Jackson Jr. emerge as the two with potential appeal for other teams.

Given these constraints, maintaining his streak of deadline deals—four in the last five years—will be no easy task for Horst. However, if he's set on shaking things up, here are four wings who could seamlessly slot into the starting lineup in lieu of Beasley.

**1. Royce O’Neale** - The Brooklyn Nets could be on the cusp of blowing up their team—they’re stuck in NBA purgatory at 16-22 with some nice, attractive pieces other teams would love to add. Dorian Finney-Smith, Dennis Smith Jr., Lonnie Walker IV, and Royce O’Neale could all be of interest for the Bucks. With Finney-Smith costing too much and Smith and Walker moving the needle too little, O’Neale might be the Goldilocks addition from the Nets’ roster—just right. He’s not the type of player who can pressure the ball 40+ feet from the hoop like head coach Adrian Griffin wants, but he does have excellent positional versatility. He can defend 2s, 3s, and even 4s. At 6-foot-6 and 226 pounds, he would also bring much-needed size to the Bucks’ starting backcourt. He also hits just enough outside shots to keep his defender honest.

**2. Quentin Grimes** - The New York Knicks are looking to upgrade their roster with another star and aren’t interested in moving rotational pieces for draft picks and prospects. However, Milwaukee might be able to get in on a three-team deal where they sneak Quentin Grimes away and send assets to a rebuilding team. Grimes isn’t the same level of defender as the other three players on this list, but he brings energy and effort to the court on every possession. He can space the court with his three-point shooting or work in as a tertiary playmaker. His defensive chops are a bit too similar to Beasley, but he has higher potential.

**3. Talen Horton-Tucker** - Talen Horton-Tucker is a chameleon on the offensive end. He can initiate the offense while creating shots for himself and others as the point guard, play off-ball on the wing, and has even spent time as a power forward during his few years in the league. That versatility should mesh nicely with the Bucks’ roster, as Griffin searches for more lineup combinations that work.

**4. Matisse Thybulle** - Besides Alex Caruso or Marcus Smart, Matisse Thybulle would be a tremendous get for Horst and the Bucks at the deadline. He’s long and rangy with an elite ability to defend on-ball and off. He can completely disrupt everything the offense is trying to do and would immediately give Milwaukee the ability to match up with the opposing team’s best perimeter player from Tyrese Maxey to Jayson Tatum to Donovan Mitchell to Jalen Brunson. You name it.

While Horst faces significant challenges in making a trade due to limited assets, these four wings could seamlessly slot into the Bucks' starting lineup, providing crucial defensive presence and bolstering their chances of success. As the trade deadline looms, Bucks fans eagerly await to see if Horst can once again work his magic and solidify their team's chances in the upcoming season.
