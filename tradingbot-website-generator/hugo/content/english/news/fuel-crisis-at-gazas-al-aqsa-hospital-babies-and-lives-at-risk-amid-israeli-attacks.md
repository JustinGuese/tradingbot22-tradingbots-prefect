### Israeli Military Attacks Leave Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in Darkness 

13 Jan 2024

The Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in central Gaza is facing a dire situation as a result of Israeli military attacks in the vicinity. The hospital, which is one of the last functioning medical facilities in the enclave, is now in complete darkness due to a fuel shortage and a total power outage. This has put the lives of the most vulnerable patients, including premature babies and those in intensive care units, at significant risk.

"We're trying to work with what we have. But we will have to stop working completely because we don't have any electricity," a doctor at the hospital expressed to Al Jazeera. The lack of power has severely hampered the ability to provide adequate medical treatment and care to patients. Earlier footage showed medical staff using flashlights to navigate through the dark rooms in an attempt to continue their work.

Premature and newborn babies are particularly at risk, with Gaza's Government Media Office stating that they are in extreme danger of death. Some doctors at the hospital shared their concerns, with one stating that they can only provide primary care under such circumstances. Malnutrition is also a serious issue among the babies in the facility, making them more susceptible to illness and potential death.

The hospital has been hosting thousands of displaced people who have sought shelter from Israel's ongoing bombardment of the coastal enclave. Since October 7, Israeli attacks on Gaza have resulted in at least 23,843 people killed and 60,317 wounded, according to Gaza's Ministry of Health.

The blackout at Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital has significant implications for the delivery of medical care. Medical Aid for Palestinians emergency physician, James Smith, highlighted that electricity is a fundamental requirement for any functioning hospital. Without electricity, the hospital's ability to provide ongoing clinical care, admit new patients, and safely transfer them to other healthcare facilities is severely hindered.

The situation is further complicated by the expanding Israeli military ground operations in central Gaza. As the hospital exists in an area considered to be a battle zone, it has already been subjected to numerous attacks, including the destruction of nearby residential buildings. The hospital now faces new threats with the expansion of Israeli military operations.

The United Nations aid chief, Martin Griffiths, recently declared that Gaza's health system is in a state of collapse. He highlighted the inability of women to give birth safely, children unable to receive vaccinations, and the limited access to treatment for the sick and injured. The overall situation is characterized by the absence of safe spaces and the near impossibility of maintaining dignified human life.

The current crisis at the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital underscores the urgent need for immediate assistance and attention to address the dire situation faced by medical facilities and patients in Gaza.
