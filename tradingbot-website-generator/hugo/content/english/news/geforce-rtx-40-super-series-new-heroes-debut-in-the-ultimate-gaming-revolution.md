# GeForce RTX 40 SUPER Series: New Heroes Debut in the Gaming and Creating Universe With AI as Their Superpower

LAS VEGAS, Jan. 08, 2024 ( GLOBE NEWSWIRE ) -- NVIDIA today announced the GeForce RTX™ 40 SUPER Series family of GPUs - including the GeForce RTX 4080 SUPER, GeForce RTX 4070 Ti SUPER, and GeForce RTX 4070 SUPER - which supercharge the latest games and form the core of AI-powered PCs. These GPUs, based on NVIDIA Ada Lovelace architecture, offer up to 52 shader TFLOPS, 121 RT TFLOPS, and 836 AI TOPS, delivering exceptional performance for gaming and creating purposes. The GeForce RTX 4070 SUPER starts at $599.

PC gamers demand high-quality visuals, and the GeForce RTX SUPER GPUs meet their expectations with NVIDIA Deep Learning Super Sampling (DLSS) Super Resolution, Frame Generation, and Ray Reconstruction. Combined with ray tracing, these features create stunning worlds in games like Diablo IV, Pax Dei, and Horizon Forbidden West. With DLSS, AI-generated pixels accelerate full ray tracing by up to 4x, while maintaining better image quality. Matt Wuebbling, vice president of global GeForce marketing at NVIDIA, stated, "For everyone from gaming enthusiasts to creative professionals, GeForce RTX SUPER GPUs are simply awesome upgrades."

The new GeForce RTX SUPER GPUs bring AI capabilities to PC computing. Specialized AI Tensor Cores provide up to 836 AI TOPS, enabling transformative capabilities for AI in gaming, creating, and everyday productivity. NVIDIA TensorRT™ software optimizes deep learning inference, delivering low latency and high throughput for inference applications. In AI workloads, the GeForce RTX 4080 SUPER performs over 1.5x faster than the RTX 3080 Ti in video generation, and over 1.7x faster in image generation. DLSS and Tensor Cores also enhance generative AI applications like Adobe Photoshop, improving productivity. NVIDIA Broadcast removes background noise and provides seamless virtual backgrounds for improved productivity.

The GeForce RTX 4080 SUPER is designed for fully ray-traced games in 4K resolution. With DLSS Frame Generation, it performs 1.4x faster than the GeForce RTX 3080 Ti, and with 836 AI TOPS, it delivers twice the performance of the RTX 3080 Ti. The RTX 4080 SUPER features more cores and faster memory for an edge in performance. It will be available starting Jan. 31 from $999.

For gamers looking for high frame rates and optimal performance, the GeForce RTX 4070 Ti SUPER is the ideal choice. It excels in maxing out games at super-high frame rates, with support for 1440p and 4K resolutions. With more cores, an increased frame buffer to 16GB, and a 256-bit memory bus, it offers a significant memory bandwidth increase to 672 GB/sec. It performs 1.6x faster than an RTX 3070 Ti, and 2.5x faster with DLSS 3. The GeForce RTX 4070 Ti SUPER will be available starting Jan. 24 at $799.

For a perfectly balanced option, the GeForce RTX 4070 SUPER is the GPU of choice. With 20% more cores than the RTX 4070, it outperforms an RTX 3090 while consuming less power. With DLSS 3, it performs 1.5x faster than the competition. The GeForce RTX 4070 SUPER will be available starting Jan. 17 at $599.

The NVIDIA Founders Edition Design of the GeForce RTX 4080 SUPER and 4070 SUPER will be available for purchase directly from NVIDIA.com and select retailers. Custom boards, including stock-clocked and factory-overclocked models, will also be available from top add-in card providers.

NVIDIA has been a pioneer in accelerated computing since its founding in 1993. Its GPUs have reshaped the PC gaming market, redefined computer graphics, and contributed to the growth of modern AI. NVIDIA continues to innovate and offer industry-leading technology in its data-center-scale offerings. More information about NVIDIA can be found at https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/.
