# Spirit AeroSystems' Stock Falls on 737 Max 9 Grounding

Shares of Spirit AeroSystems Holdings Inc. plummeted on Monday as investors reacted to news of the grounding of Boeing Co.'s 737 Max 9 planes. The aircraft-components maker has faced criticism for its role in the grounding, which also impacted other commercial aerospace companies.

Truist analyst Michael Ciarmoli highlighted Spirit AeroSystems as the company most affected by the grounding, given its status as a key supplier for Boeing. He noted that the company has experienced quality escape issues in the past year. Spirit AeroSystems' stock dropped 8.1% in morning trading, marking its biggest one-day decline since August 2023 when it faced a similar quality issue.

Boeing Co.'s stock also fell 6.8% in response to the news, while the overall Dow Jones Industrial Average dipped 0.2%. The grounding of the 737 Max 9 planes is expected to impact the financial performance of several commercial aerospace suppliers.

In its audited third-quarter filing, Spirit AeroSystems revealed that Boeing accounted for 61.4% of its total revenue, or $883.9 million. While the grounding is not expected to halt production, Ciarmoli cautioned that the Federal Aviation Administration's investigation is still ongoing, and the full extent of the costs associated with the issue remain unknown.

Ciarmoli estimates that the Max will make up approximately 41% of Spirit AeroSystems' revenue for this year, assuming the production of 504 Max aircraft. Several other companies will also be impacted by the grounding, including Astronics Corp., Triumph Group Inc., Howmet Aerospace Inc., Ducommun Inc., Hexcel Corp., Albany International Corp., Woodward Inc., RBC Bearings Inc., Barnes Group Inc., Curtiss-Wright Corp., and Moog Inc.

On the other hand, FTAI Aviation Ltd., which provides aircraft-leasing services, may see a boost in the near term as airlines look to lease narrow-body aircraft to replace the grounded 737s.

The grounding of the 737 Max 9 planes poses significant challenges for Spirit AeroSystems and other commercial aerospace suppliers. The investigation into the issue is ongoing, and the financial impact on these companies remains uncertain. Investors will be closely monitoring developments as the situation progresses.
