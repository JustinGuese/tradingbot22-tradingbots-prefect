## summary

## Hedera network approves $408M of HBAR for ecosystem growth

The Hedera Global Governing Council has approved the allocation of 4.86 billion HBAR, the native cryptocurrency of the Hedera network, worth approximately $408 million, for further development and decentralized governance. The majority of the funds, 4.248 billion HBAR, will be directed towards existing initiatives such as the HBAR Foundation, the Hashgraph Association, and the DLT Science Foundation. This allocation aligns with Hedera's goal to strengthen its base following its 2023 performance, characterized by over 33 billion real-world transactions on the network.

In addition to supporting ecosystem growth, 614.06 million HBAR will be used for the council's operational costs and to compensate early simple agreements for future token buyers.

Betsabe Botaitis, the council's chief financial officer, stated that the HBAR Foundation and Hashgraph Association grants are scheduled for disbursement in the first quarter of 2024. The DLT Science Foundation will receive grants as it achieves critical milestones throughout the year. Botaitis emphasized the importance of ecosystem partners in boosting Hedera's rapid adoption, expressing the council's commitment to backing network development and use through these new grants.

In related news, the HBAR Foundation and the Algorand Foundation recently announced the establishment of the DeRec Alliance, which aims to create a decentralized recovery system for digital assets.

The allocation of $408 million worth of HBAR demonstrates Hedera's commitment to further development and decentralized governance. With its strong performance in 2023, Hedera aims to strengthen its base and continue driving network growth.
