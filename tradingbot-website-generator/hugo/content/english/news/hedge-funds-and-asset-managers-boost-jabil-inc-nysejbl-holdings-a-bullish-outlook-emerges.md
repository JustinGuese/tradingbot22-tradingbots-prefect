# Hedge Funds and Asset Managers Increasing Holdings in Jabil Inc.

According to recent institutional holdings data from Quiver Quantitative, hedge funds and asset managers have been increasing their holdings in Jabil Inc. (JBL). Firms such as Fidelity, Point72 Asset Management, and Whale Rock Capital Management have all recently added to their JBL positions.

Fidelity, in particular, increased its shares held by 15.86%, bringing its total JBL holdings to 10,525,084 shares worth around $1.3 billion at current market prices.

The increase in holdings by these institutional investors suggests a bullish sentiment towards Jabil Inc. and its prospects for future growth.

Jabil Inc. reported its earnings results for the first quarter of FY24 in December. During this quarter, the company generated $8.4 billion in net revenue, with GAAP EBIT of $303 million and GAAP Diluted EPS of $1.47 per share.

Looking ahead to the second quarter of FY24, Jabil's management has projected net revenue of $7 - $7.6 billion, GAAP EBIT of $216 - $301 million, and GAAP Diluted EPS of $0.77 to $1.37 per share. These projections indicate a potential weakening in earnings due to softened demand.

Despite the softened demand, Jabil Inc. CEO Kenny Wilson remains optimistic about the company's performance. He stated, "Despite softer demand, the team delivered good year-over-year growth in core margins and core earnings per share."

Jabil Inc. is a leading global provider of manufacturing services and solutions, specializing in electronics design, production, and product management. The company generates revenue by offering services that optimize manufacturing costs, enhance supply chain management, and streamline product delivery.

Jabil operates through two main segments: Electronics Manufacturing Services (EMS) and Diversified Manufacturing Services (DMS). The EMS segment focuses on high-volume electronics production for industries such as 5G, wireless, cloud, and industrial equipment. The DMS segment provides engineering solutions for sectors like automotive, healthcare, and connected devices.

In the highly competitive manufacturing services industry, Jabil Inc. faces competition from both domestic and international players. Key factors for success in this industry include cost-effectiveness, quick time-to-market for new products, quality of services, and technological prowess.

To sustain growth, Jabil Inc. aims to expand and diversify its offerings and customer base. The company focuses on maintaining long-term relationships with key customers in high-growth industries and expanding its customer-centric business units. Jabil also emphasizes product diversification and pursues strategic acquisitions to enhance capabilities and reach new markets.

Jabil's management is committed to creating long-term shareholder value. The company has a history of share repurchases, having bought back over $3 billion worth of common stock since FY16. In addition, Jabil offers quarterly cash dividends on common stock.

The company's financial health is solid, with manageable long-term debt and strong operating income relative to interest expenses. Jabil has also shown sustained growth in net income and free cash flow, with positive trends in operating income and margin expansion.

Based on a reverse discounted cash flow analysis, Jabil Inc. appears to be trading at a valuation that implies a conservative growth rate in free cash flow over the next ten years. However, the analysis suggests that the stock is undervalued, with a fair price estimated to be around $157 per share.

Investors should conduct their own due diligence before making any investment decisions.
