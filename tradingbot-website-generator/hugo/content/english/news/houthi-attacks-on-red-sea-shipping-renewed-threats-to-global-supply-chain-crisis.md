# Houthi attacks on shipping in the Red Sea risk reigniting global supply chain crisis

*Published: January 13, 2024 9:00am EST*

Attacks by the Iran-backed Houthi militants on commercial shipping vessels in the Red Sea, a critical juncture point for world trade, risk reigniting a supply chain crisis just as the global economy begins to recover from high inflation, chronic shortages, and bottlenecks.

Shipping costs are already on the rise eight weeks after the Yemeni rebel group first began targeting ships sailing through the Red Sea and the Suez Canal. About 15% of world shipping traffic, including 30% of global container trade, passes through the Suez Canal. But to avoid being attacked or having their cargo stolen, many ships are instead sailing around the Cape of Good Hope, which is the long way around the continent of Africa.

"This has added significant cost, and also significant delays, to shipments that are coming from the Middle East, to and from Europe, and other regions in that area, that rely on the Suez Canal a great deal," said Robert Handfield, a professor of operations and supply chain management at North Carolina State University.

Ship traffic through the Suez Canal has plummeted, with a 30% decrease between January 1 and January 11 compared to the same period last year. Container shipping giant Maersk suspended the use of the Red Sea and Suez Canal after one of its vessels was attacked by the Houthi militants. The company has warned of "significant" consequences for global growth as a result of the disruptions.

Routing ships around Africa, which increases journey length by about two and a half weeks, has reduced effective capacity and is pushing up shipping prices. Rates for shipping goods from Asia to Northern Europe have risen by 173% compared to before the diversion of vessels in the region began. Carriers have also announced surcharges ranging from $500 to as much as $2,700 per container.

Drought-like conditions in the Panama Canal have further compounded the pain from the attacks in the Red Sea. The Panama Canal has restricted the number of ships passing through it due to extremely low water levels, resulting in further delays and disruptions to global shipments.

The spike in shipping costs and potential snarls in global trade routes are stoking fears about a resurgence in inflation. Bank of America analysts have warned that the disruptions to the Red Sea, Suez Canal, and Panama Canal could delay recent declines in inflation.

While the impact on American consumers remains minimal for now, certain categories of goods and services may experience "some price increases," according to Professor Handfield. Commodities coming from the region, such as rare earth minerals, chemicals, and certain types of grain, could be affected. The impact may be more significant in Europe and other countries.

As the global economy tries to recover from existing challenges, the escalating attacks on shipping in the Red Sea pose a significant threat to the stability of supply chains, potentially impacting global trade and further exacerbating inflation concerns.
