## summary

# Is the Inflation Reduction Act alone a good enough reason to buy Century Aluminum stock?

Investment bank B. Riley has upgraded Century Aluminum stock to buy, citing the potential benefits the company could receive from President Biden's Inflation Reduction Act. B. Riley believes Century Aluminum could receive up to $200 million in annual tax credits under the act. However, it's worth noting that Century Aluminum will likely have to use the majority of those tax credits just to return to profitability.

Century Aluminum, the largest domestic producer of primary aluminum in the U.S., saw its stock price jump 14% in response to the upgrade. B. Riley is optimistic about the company's future prospects, particularly due to the potential cash infusion from the Biden administration.

The key to B. Riley's upgrade is the production tax credits offered by the Inflation Reduction Act. Century Aluminum expects to claim a tax credit of $55 million to $60 million on its 2023 earnings based on a provision in the act. This provision offers a tax credit equal to 10% of the cost of production of certain critical minerals, including primary aluminum.

B. Riley believes Century Aluminum could benefit even more from the act. The analyst suggests that the company could realize roughly $200 million in annual benefits if material costs are included and the company achieves 100% utilization in the U.S.

Even if Century Aluminum doesn't fully capitalize on all the tax credits, B. Riley believes the stock could still be a good investment. The analyst suggests that achieving 100% capacity use at Century's Mt. Holly production plant and reactivating its aluminum plant in Hawesville, Kentucky, to 50% use would justify the 40% gains in stock price anticipated.

However, it's important to note that Century Aluminum would still need to receive almost the full $200 million in annual tax credits to offset the $175 million in losses it incurred over the past year and return to profitability.

While B. Riley makes a compelling argument for Century Aluminum stock, it's not yet clear if the tax credits will be enough to make the company profitable again. As such, it may be prudent for investors to exercise caution before buying Century Aluminum stock.
