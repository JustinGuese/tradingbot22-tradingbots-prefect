# Flash Motors Nano Elite Debuts at CES 2024 in Las Vegas

LAS VEGAS â€“ Flash Motors, a leading electric scooter manufacturer, unveiled its newest innovation, the Nano Elite Next-Generation Electric Scooter Controllers, at this year's CES trade show. The Flash Motors Nano Elite series made its debut on January 11 at the Las Vegas Consumer Electronics Show (CES) 2024 trade fair, showcasing cutting-edge technology designed to enhance the riding experience for scooter enthusiasts.

The Nano Elite controllers, equipped with the latest artificial intelligence (AI) technology, provide a range of benefits for electric scooter riders. With plug-and-play functionality, installation is quick and easy. The controllers constantly fine-tune settings through auto-tune technology, ensuring optimal performance and safety. Riders can also customize acceleration rate, speed limits, torque level, and more, giving them complete control over their ride.

One standout feature of the Nano Elite controllers is their ability to drive the scooter autonomously. By gathering data from the rider, the controllers can learn driving patterns and preferences, allowing the scooter to operate on its own. Additionally, the controllers offer regenerative braking, which conserves energy every time the scooter decelerates.

The Nano Elite series features three models catering to different rider preferences. The X3K, priced at $650, provides a basic yet reliable option for everyday use with a maximum power of 4,500W. The X5K, priced at $950, offers a perfect balance of power and versatility with a max output of 14,000W. Finally, the X28K, priced at $1,250, is designed for riders who enjoy tackling rough terrains, boasting a power limit of 28,000W and a 600A max phase current.

Flash Motors aims to provide scooter enthusiasts with the ultimate riding experience through the Nano Elite Next-Generation Electric Scooter Controllers. These controllers offer advanced technology, customization options, and enhanced safety features, all of which contribute to an elevated riding experience.
