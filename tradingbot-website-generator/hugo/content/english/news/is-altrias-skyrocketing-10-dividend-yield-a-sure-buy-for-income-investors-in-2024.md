# Altria's Dividend Yield Skyrockets: Is it Safe for Income Investors?

*Date: January 13, 2024*

Altria Group, known for its presence in the tobacco industry, is making waves with its impressive dividend yield. With a yield of 9.5%, Altria's dividend is certainly appealing to income investors looking to generate steady returns. However, investors are questioning whether this dividend yield is sustainable in the long term.

Higher dividend yields typically accompany declining stock prices, and this seems to be the case for Altria. Over the past five years, shares of the cigarette giant have declined by 15.6%. Despite this decline, Altria has increased its quarterly dividend by 22.5%, further inflating the stock's yield.

Altria faces challenges within the tobacco industry, which is slowly declining due to factors such as rising interest rates and new regulations related to the health impacts of smoking. The company has tried to diversify and adapt to these challenges by entering new markets, such as investing in vape brand Juul Labs and acquiring e-cigarette maker NJOY. However, these efforts will take time to generate significant growth.

Despite these challenges, Altria has been able to maintain its dividend payout. By consistently raising prices and improving its gross margin, the company has been able to sustain profitability. Altria also frequently repurchases shares, which boosts earnings and reduces future dividend payments.

In the third quarter of 2023, Altria's net revenue declined by 4.1% due to declining cigarette volumes, but its operating income only fell by 0.7%. The company's payout ratio of 77% may seem high, but it is in line with historical levels. In comparison, fellow tobacco company Philip Morris International has a slightly higher payout ratio of 85%.

Altria has a track record of increasing its dividend payout annually for the past 58 years. While the tobacco industry may not offer significant organic growth potential, a combination of price hikes, strong margins, and investments in new technologies should help Altria maintain its tradition of returning capital to shareholders.

In conclusion, Altria's high dividend yield is attractive to income investors, but it is important to consider the underlying challenges the company faces in the tobacco industry. Despite these challenges, Altria has shown resilience and has a history of maintaining its dividend payout. Therefore, it may be considered a solid buy for long-term investors seeking reliable income.
