# JetBlue's Stock Tumbles After Analyst Sees 40% Downside

Shares of JetBlue Airways Corp. took a hard hit on Tuesday, following an analyst's call to sell the stock and after the air carrier announced that its long-time chief executive was retiring for health reasons. BofA Securities' Andrew Didora cut his rating on the stock to underperform, after being at neutral for the past five months. He slashed his price target to $3 from $6, with the new target implying about 42% downside from current levels, making Didora the most bearish of the 14 analysts surveyed by FactSet who cover the stock.

The stock tumbled 10.6% in midday trading, which puts it on track to suffer the biggest one-day drop since June 13, 2022. The selloff snaps a three-day win streak in which it ran up 16.8%. Didora cited the "tough domestic airline industry" characterized by increasing domestic supply, cost inflation, and easing travel demand as factors pressuring growth and costs in 2024. He also mentioned issues surrounding the manufacturing problems with some of the Pratt & Whitney jet engines JetBlue uses as a potential drag on earnings.

In addition to the downgrade, the company announced that Chief Executive Robert Hayes will retire from the airline on February 12 after nine years in the role. Joanna Geraghty, currently JetBlue's chief operating officer, was named Hayes' successor. Along with the CEO succession announcement, JetBlue said demand in December remained "healthy" while operational performance during the busy holiday schedule remained "strong." Therefore, JetBlue said it expects fourth-quarter results to be at the "better end" of the guidance ranges provided in early December.

JetBlue's stock has rallied 13.8% over the past three months but has plunged 29.5% over the past 12 months. The U.S. Global Jets ETF JETS, which tracks the performance of the airline industry, has gained 1.7% over the past year while the S&P 500 index has rallied 22.1%.
