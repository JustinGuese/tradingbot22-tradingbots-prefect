## summary

Choice Hotels International, Inc. is showcasing the diverse portfolio of its hotel brands with its latest advertising campaign. The campaign, which features actor and comedian Keegan-Michael Key, aims to highlight the various hotel options available within the Choice portfolio. The campaign comes as Choice Hotels enjoys a period of growth in digital traffic and bookings, following the integration of Radisson Hotels Americas. Choice acquired Radisson Hotels Americas in August 2022, adding approximately 600 franchised hotels to its portfolio. The marketing push also coincides with Choice's ongoing attempt to acquire Wyndham Hotels & Resorts. Despite facing pushback from Wyndham's leadership and the Asian American Hotel Owners Association, Choice remains committed to its pursuit of the takeover. With this advertising campaign, Choice Hotels aims to attract a wider audience and solidify its position as a leading player in the hospitality industry.
