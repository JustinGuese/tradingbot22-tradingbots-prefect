# Kevin Hart's 'Lift' Shows How the Netflix Algorithm Has Revived the 'B Movie'

Kevin Hart's latest movie "Lift" may not be groundbreaking, but it serves as a shining example of the power of the Netflix algorithm. By analyzing user data and catering to specific preferences, Netflix has revived the concept of the "B movie" and created a platform for star-driven productions that piggyback on successful projects.

For actors like Hart, this arrangement offers a remarkable amount of freedom to explore different roles and genres. Whether it's a straightforward caper film like "Lift" or Hart's dramatic turn in the Netflix series "True Story," the streaming giant provides a space for talent to stretch their creative muscles. Some have even taken advantage of this latitude to collaborate with family members, such as Jamie Foxx and his daughter Corinne in the sitcom "Dad Stop Embarrassing Me!" or Adam Sandler starring alongside his entire brood in "You Are So Not Invited to My Bat Mitzvah."

While these star-driven productions might have the feel of traditional "B movies," which were once paired with more prominent films in theaters, their purpose has shifted to streaming platforms. Although "Lift" doesn't fit the typical definition of a low-budget "B movie," it functions in a similar manner by leveraging the success and popularity of previous Kevin Hart projects. If you enjoy Hart's stand-up specials or the "Jumanji" reboot, Netflix has got you covered with "Lift."

According to the Wall Street Journal, Netflix's data analysis, powered by proprietary technology, plays a crucial role in the company's decision-making process. It informs them on what shows and movies to produce, whether to renew them, and how to recommend them to viewers. While this approach has undoubtedly contributed to Netflix's success, it occasionally leads to a whiff of commercialism overshadowing true creative inspiration in some projects.

In the case of "Lift," Kevin Hart takes on the role of a crack thief working with an international team of accomplices to pull off a high-stakes heist. Teaming up with Interpol agent Gugu Mbatha-Raw, Hart's character finds himself recruited by the authorities to rob an airplane carrying $500 million in gold. Despite the movie's high-tech gadgetry and modern twists, it echoes the concept of the 1960s TV show "It Takes a Thief" by blending government agents with notorious criminals.

While the star-vehicle approach adopted by Netflix has produced a mix of forgettable movies and a few gems, it remains a clear strategy for the streaming service. The aim is to cater to viewers who enjoy the work of actors like Hart, Sandler, Foxx, and Reynolds. For Netflix and similar services, the modern-day "B movie" formula seems to be paying off. Viewers, on the other hand, may have a mixed track record with films like "Lift," but they are just a click away from finding something that aligns more with their personal taste.

"Lift" premiered on Netflix on January 12 and is rated PG-13.
