## summary

NVIDIA, a leading technology company known for its graphics processing units (GPUs), announced today that Li Auto, a pioneer in extended-range electric vehicles (EVs), has chosen the NVIDIA DRIVE Thor centralized car computer to power its next-generation fleets. In addition, other EV makers including GWM (Great Wall Motor), ZEEKR, and Xiaomi have also selected the NVIDIA DRIVE Orin platform to integrate into their intelligent automated-driving systems.

According to Xinzhou Wu, Vice President of Automotive at NVIDIA, the transportation industry is embracing centralized compute for highly automated and autonomous driving. Automakers are increasingly looking to NVIDIA DRIVE Thor for its advanced capabilities and AI performance in their future vehicle roadmaps.

DRIVE Thor is a next-generation centralized car computer that combines various intelligent functions into a single AI compute platform. It provides autonomous driving and parking capabilities, driver and passenger monitoring, and AI cockpit functionality. Li Auto currently uses two DRIVE Orin processors to power its assisted-driving system, AD Max, for its L-series models.

GWM, a prominent Chinese new energy vehicle manufacturer, plans to build its self-developed, high-end intelligent-driving system called the Coffee Pilot on the DRIVE Orin platform. This system can support parking, high-speed, and urban scenes to achieve full-scenario smart navigation and assisted-driving functions without the need for high-precision maps. GWM will debut its first model with the Coffee Pilot system in the first half of this year, with advanced intelligent-driving features to be rolled out in its WEY models.

ZEEKR, the luxury EV subsidiary of Geely, has launched the ZEEKR Luxury Sedan, powered by the NVIDIA DRIVE Orin platform. This sedan features a new full-stack smart driving system that offers intelligent parking and automated operation on high-speed and urban roads. ZEEKR's range of models is available with two sensor options: Lidar + Vision Fusion and Pure Vision. The Navigation ZEEKR Pilot, a highway navigation function developed in-house, will be available for use in major Chinese cities.

Xiaomi EV, the automotive arm of the technology giant Xiaomi, has announced its first EV, the SU7 sedan, which is built on a dual DRIVE Orin configuration for highway driving functions. With Xiaomi's leading large language model for perception and decision-making, the sedan will be able to navigate through Chinese cities seamlessly, regardless of location, administrative divisions, or road types. The SU7 will be officially launched in the first half of 2024.

NVIDIA's DRIVE Orin platform, which offers up to 254 TOPS (trillions of operations per second), has been in production with leading automakers, trucks, robotaxis, and shuttles since 2022. It is scalable to support level 2+ to level 5 self-driving capabilities.

NVIDIA's collaborations with Li Auto, GWM, ZEEKR, and Xiaomi highlight the increasing demand for advanced computing solutions in the automotive industry as it moves towards automated and autonomous driving. With its DRIVE Thor and DRIVE Orin platforms, NVIDIA is at the forefront of providing the AI and computing power needed to drive the future of transportation.
