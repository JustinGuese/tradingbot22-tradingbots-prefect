# Li Auto Selects DRIVE Thor for Next-Gen EVs
#### GWM, ZEEKR and Xiaomi Develop AI-Driven Cars Powered by NVIDIA DRIVE Orin

LAS VEGAS, Jan. 08, 2024 - Li Auto, a pioneer in extended-range electric vehicles (EVs), has announced that it has chosen the NVIDIA DRIVE Thor centralized car computer to power its next-generation fleets. In addition, EV makers GWM (Great Wall Motor), ZEEKR, and Xiaomi have all adopted the NVIDIA DRIVE Orin platform to power their intelligent automated-driving systems.

NVIDIA, a leader in accelerated computing, is at the forefront of the transportation industry's move towards centralized compute for highly automated and autonomous driving. Xinzhou Wu, vice president of automotive at NVIDIA, stated, "The AI car computer of choice for today's intelligent fleets is NVIDIA DRIVE Orin, with automakers increasingly looking to the advanced capabilities and AI performance of its successor, NVIDIA DRIVE Thor, for their future vehicle roadmaps."

The NVIDIA DRIVE Thor is a next-generation centralized car computer that integrates various intelligent functions into a single AI compute platform. It offers autonomous driving and parking capabilities, driver and passenger monitoring, and AI cockpit functionality.

Li Auto is currently utilizing two NVIDIA DRIVE Orin processors to power its assisted-driving system, AD Max, for its L-series models. These processors provide a combined 508 trillion operations per second (TOPS), enabling real-time processing of sensor information. This allows for full-scenario autonomous driving, advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS) navigation, lane change control, automated parking, and automatic emergency braking.

With their AD Max 3.0 upgrade, Li Auto is transitioning to an end-to-end algorithmic architecture dominated by large AI models. This upgrade will deliver a safer and more comfortable intelligent driving experience, thanks to an occupancy network and spatio-temporal trajectory planning and model-predictive control algorithms.

GWM, one of China's leading new energy vehicle makers, has announced that it will build its self-developed high-end intelligent-driving system, the Coffee Pilot, based on the NVIDIA DRIVE Orin centralized computing platform. GWM collaborated with NVIDIA to develop this system, and it will debut in the first half of the year.

ZEEKR, the premium EV subsidiary of Geely, has launched its ZEEKR Luxury Sedan, which is powered by two NVIDIA DRIVE Orin systems-on-a-chip. This sedan features a full-stack smart driving system that enables intelligent parking and automated operation on high-speed and urban roads.

Xiaomi EV, the automotive arm of the technology giant Xiaomi, has announced its first EV, the SU7 sedan, which utilizes a dual NVIDIA DRIVE Orin configuration for highway driving functions. This sedan will be capable of seamlessly navigating through Chinese cities, regardless of locale, administrative divisions, or road type.

NVIDIA's DRIVE Orin has been in production with leading automakers, trucks, robotaxis, and shuttles since 2022. It offers up to 254 TOPS and is scalable to support level 2+ to level 5 self-driving capabilities.

NVIDIA continues to innovate and collaborate with industry-leading players to advance the future of transportation. The company's technologies are reshaping the automotive industry, offering greener and smarter mobility for all.
