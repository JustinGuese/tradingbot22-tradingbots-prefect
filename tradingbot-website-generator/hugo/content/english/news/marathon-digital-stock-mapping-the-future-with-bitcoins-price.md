# **Where Will Marathon Digital Stock Be in 10 Years?**

By Leo Sun â€“ Jan 13, 2024 at 7:45AM

Marathon Digital (NASDAQ: MARA) has emerged as the world's largest "pure play" Bitcoin miner, and its fate is closely tied to the price of the cryptocurrency. Over the past six years, Marathon has transformed from a small patent holding company into a major player in the Bitcoin mining industry. Its stock has experienced significant volatility, but has rallied over the past year as Bitcoin's price has surged. The question now is whether Marathon's stock can continue to soar over the next decade as Bitcoin becomes more mainstream.

Marathon's main strategy is to continuously expand its fleet of Bitcoin miners, taking advantage of economies of scale to reduce energy costs. Additionally, the company periodically sells some of its own Bitcoin to improve liquidity. These strategies are dependent on the price of Bitcoin rising rapidly enough to offset mining expenses. However, when Bitcoin's price plunged in 2022, Marathon's net loss widened significantly.

Analysts believe that three catalysts could fuel a rally in Bitcoin's price: the stabilization of interest rates, recent approvals of Bitcoin ETFs by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and the upcoming halving of Bitcoin rewards for miners. If Bitcoin's price rises, Marathon could accelerate its consolidation of the mining market and achieve economies of scale, reducing costs.

However, the long-term forecasts for Bitcoin's price are varied. While estimates range from $240,000 to $1 billion by 2035, it's difficult to predict the exact future value of Bitcoin. Nonetheless, with the recent approvals of Bitcoin ETFs and the stabilization of macroeconomic and regulatory factors, Bitcoin's current price of about $46,000 could mark a near-term bottom.

Marathon's stock could potentially benefit from Bitcoin's future price stability and rise. If Bitcoin becomes a mainstream asset and currency, its price could triple or quadruple, leading to significant gains for Marathon and its investors. However, the journey may not be smooth, as Bitcoin's price remains volatile and another bear market could pose risks to the mining industry.

In conclusion, Marathon Digital's fate is tightly tethered to Bitcoin's price. If Bitcoin continues to rise and stabilize, Marathon's stock could soar over the next 10 years. However, there are risks involved, and investors should remain cautious and informed about the volatility of the cryptocurrency market.
