# Innovative new collection of sticker stampers with activity pads reimagines sticker play

WILTON, Conn., Jan. 8, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Melissa & Doug, the leading preschool brand for wooden and sustainable toys, has announced the national launch of Sticker WOW!™. This innovative collection combines sticker play with stamping action, kid-favorite themes, collectible characters, and purposeful activity pages.

Sticker WOW!™ features sticker stampers that are specially designed for little hands and come with 300 pre-loaded stickers in 100 unique designs. The stampers dispense stickers smoothly and efficiently, eliminating the need to peel off backing. Each stamper also includes a 24-page activity pad with fun and engaging activities like counting and matching, helping to build fine motor and problem-solving skills.

According to Sofia Dumery, SVP of Design at Melissa & Doug, there has been little innovation in the sticker category, and the purpose of Sticker WOW!™ was to offer a fresh and exciting new way to play. The stampers and activity pads are an expansion of their popular large format sticker activity books and wooden stamp sets.

Sticker WOW!™ offers four playful characters to choose from, each with their own themed sticker designs and activities. The initial collection includes Cupcake™ the Unicorn, Olive™ the Dinosaur, Cocoa™ the Dog, and Pumpkin™ the Tiger. These collectible characters are sure to spark the imagination and creativity of children.

In honor of National Sticker Day on January 13, Melissa & Doug is hosting a giveaway on their social media channels where three lucky winners will receive a set of all four Sticker WOW!™ Activity Pad & Sticker Stamper characters. Additionally, Melissa & Doug is offering free Sticker WOW!™ printables on their blog, featuring character bios and coloring and stamping activities. 

Parents and caregivers can find Sticker WOW!™ at MelissaAndDoug.com, the Melissa & Doug retail store in White Plains, NY, as well as Walmart, Amazon, and independent retailers nationwide. For more information on open-ended, screen-free play and access to additional resources, visit MelissaAndDoug.com.
