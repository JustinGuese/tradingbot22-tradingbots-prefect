## summary

# Microsoft overtakes Apple as world's most valuable public company

Microsoft has surpassed Apple as the world's most valuable publicly traded company, with a market capitalization of $2.89 trillion. The tech giant's investment in AI has boosted its share price value this year, allowing it to overtake its long-time rival. This milestone comes after Microsoft impressed developers with its AI capabilities at an event in San Francisco. Analysts have noted the momentum around Microsoft's mature AI products and predict that the AI boom will continue throughout 2024.

In contrast, Apple has encountered some challenges at the start of the year. The company is involved in a public legal battle that has blocked US sales of its Apple Watch and has experienced three stock downgrades in January alone. Its problems in China are also expected to persist, as Chinese government officials are prohibited from using Apple devices and local competitors like Huawei are gaining traction. Jefferies analysts have reported a 30% year-on-year decline in iPhone 15 sales in China.

Microsoft's rise to the top reflects the growing importance of AI in the tech industry. As companies increasingly incorporate AI technology into their products and services, investors are captivated by the potential growth and profitability it offers. With its strategic investments in AI, Microsoft has positioned itself as a leader in this rapidly evolving field.

As the competition between Microsoft and Apple intensifies, it will be interesting to see how both companies navigate the challenges and opportunities presented by the AI revolution.
