# Moody's Outperforms Market Over the Past 15 Years

In the world of finance, consistent performance and solid returns are what investors look for in a company. Moody's (MCO), a leading provider of credit ratings and risk analysis, has certainly delivered on that front. Over the past 15 years, Moody's has outperformed the market by 8.5% on an annualized basis, boasting an impressive average annual return of 20.4%.

With a market capitalization of $68.22 billion, Moody's has established itself as a major player in the financial services industry. Its success can be attributed to its expertise in credit ratings and risk management, which provide valuable insights for investors and financial institutions alike.

If we take a closer look at the numbers, it becomes clear just how significant Moody's performance has been. Let's say an investor had bought $100 worth of MCO stock 15 years ago. Today, that investment would be worth $1,621.38 based on the current price of $372.75 per share.

The key takeaway from Moody's impressive performance is the power of compounded returns. Over time, even a relatively small investment can grow exponentially and produce substantial returns. This serves as a reminder to investors to consider the long-term impact of their investments and the potential for compounding growth.
