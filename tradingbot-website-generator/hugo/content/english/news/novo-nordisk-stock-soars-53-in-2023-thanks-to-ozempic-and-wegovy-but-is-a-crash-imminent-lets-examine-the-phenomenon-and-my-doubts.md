# The Rise of Ozempic and Wegovy Helps Novo Nordisk Stock Surge Over 50%

***By Adam Spatacco â€“ Jan 13, 2024 at 10:30AM***

Novo Nordisk, the Danish pharmaceutical company, experienced significant growth last year thanks to the success of its weight treatments, Ozempic and Wegovy. The stock surged over 50%, outperforming the S&P 500 and making Novo Nordisk Europe's most valuable company by market capitalization.

The popularity of Novo Nordisk's weight-monitoring treatments, including Ozempic, Wegovy, Rybelsus, and Saxenda, contributed to the company's unprecedented growth. Sales for GLP-1 medications, in particular, increased by 49% year over year, with Ozempic accounting for 46% of the market. Novo Nordisk's obesity care sales also saw a 174% year-over-year increase, driven by the success of Wegovy, which experienced a nearly 500% sales growth in the US alone.

The demand for Novo Nordisk's weight-management medications has been exceptional, leading to a surge in the company's stock price. However, investors may wonder if this growth is sustainable and if a sell-off is imminent.

There are two primary factors that could lead to a potential sell-off in Novo Nordisk stock. First, rival company Eli Lilly is gaining traction with its alternative to Ozempic, called Mounjaro. Mounjaro has already become Eli Lilly's second-largest revenue stream since its FDA approval in 2022, and the recent approval of Zepbound, a sibling treatment to Mounjaro, could challenge Novo Nordisk's dominance in the diabetes and obesity care markets.

The second factor that could impact Novo Nordisk's stock is negative news surrounding any of its medications. Reports of hospitalizations from overdosing on Ozempic and Wegovy, as well as side effects such as nausea, dizziness, and kidney problems associated with Ozempic, could lead to concerns among investors. Despite these concerns, it's important to note that side effects are a common occurrence in the pharmaceutical industry.

However, the entrance of Eli Lilly's competing medications and the rising global prevalence of diabetes suggest a significant market opportunity. While Novo Nordisk investors may consider diversifying their portfolios by holding positions in both companies as a hedge, the long-term prospects for Novo Nordisk remain positive. The company's strong position in the weight monitoring market and the potential for continued demand make it an attractive investment.

In conclusion, Novo Nordisk's stock surged over 50% last year due to the success of its weight treatments Ozempic and Wegovy. While there may be potential risks, such as competition from Eli Lilly and concerns about side effects, the long-term prospects for Novo Nordisk remain promising. Investors should carefully monitor the situation and consider diversification, but panic selling may not be necessary at this time.
