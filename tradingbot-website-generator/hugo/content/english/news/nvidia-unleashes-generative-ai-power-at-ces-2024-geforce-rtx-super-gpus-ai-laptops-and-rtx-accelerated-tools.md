# NVIDIA Announces New GeForce RTX SUPER GPUs and AI Laptops

LAS VEGAS, Jan. 08, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- CES-NVIDIA today announced the launch of new GeForce RTX™ SUPER desktop GPUs, AI laptops, and software and tools for generative AI. These advancements are aimed at enhancing PC experiences with AI and are expected to have a transformative impact on various industries.

NVIDIA, with its massive installed base of over 100 million RTX AI PCs and workstations, is now providing tools to developers and consumers to harness the power of generative AI. The company is offering new AI capabilities, including NVIDIA TensorRT acceleration for text-to-image workflows, NVIDIA RTX Remix with generative AI texture tools, and more games that utilize DLSS 3 technology with Frame Generation.

To further support AI developers, NVIDIA is introducing the AI Workbench, a unified toolkit that simplifies AI model customization and optimization. The toolkit will be available in beta later this month and will provide access to popular AI repositories such as Hugging Face, GitHub, and NVIDIA NGC.

NVIDIA is also expanding its RTX AI ecosystem by partnering with leading manufacturers. Acer, ASUS, Dell, HP, Lenovo, MSI, Razer, and Samsung will release new RTX AI laptops that offer a full set of generative AI capabilities. These laptops are expected to deliver a performance increase of 20x to 60x compared to using neural processing units.

Mobile workstations equipped with RTX GPUs will support NVIDIA AI Enterprise software, including TensorRT and NVIDIA RAPIDS, enabling simplified and secure generative AI and data science development.

Additionally, NVIDIA is launching several new generative AI-powered applications and services for PCs. NVIDIA RTX Remix, releasing in beta, will allow users to create stunning remasters of classic games using generative AI tools. NVIDIA ACE microservices will enable developers to add intelligent digital avatars to games. TensorRT acceleration will enhance the performance of popular Stable Diffusion XL models and the NVIDIA DLSS 3 with Frame Generation will significantly increase frame rates in RTX games.
