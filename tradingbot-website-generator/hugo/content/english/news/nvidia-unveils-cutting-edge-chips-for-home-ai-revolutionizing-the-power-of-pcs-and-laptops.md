# Nvidia Strengthens Consumer GPUs for Local AI Applications

Nvidia, a leading technology company known for its high-performance graphics processing units (GPUs), is emphasizing its strength in consumer GPUs for "local" artificial intelligence (AI) applications that can run on PCs or laptops. While Nvidia's GPUs have traditionally been used for video games, the company is now highlighting their improved capabilities for running AI models without relying on cloud-based processing.

Nvidia recently introduced three new graphics cards - the RTX 4060 Super, RTX 4070 Ti Super, and RTX 4080 Super - priced between $599 and $999. These cards feature additional "tensor cores" designed specifically for running generative AI applications. Nvidia will also collaborate with laptop manufacturers like Acer, Dell, and Lenovo to incorporate their graphics cards into their products.

The demand for Nvidia's enterprise GPUs, which are used for training and deploying generative AI models, has propelled the company's sales and market value to exceed $1 trillion. While consumer GPUs have primarily targeted gamers, Nvidia's new graphics cards have been optimized for AI applications, enabling them to process AI tasks alongside gaming functions. For example, the RTX 4080 Super can generate AI video 150% faster than its predecessor. Nvidia has also introduced software improvements, making large language model processing five times faster.

"With 100 million RTX GPUs shipped, they provide a massive installed base for powerful PCs for AI applications," said Justin Walker, Nvidia's senior director of product management. Nvidia anticipates the emergence of new AI applications in the coming year, fueled by the increased processing power of their GPUs. Additionally, Microsoft's upcoming Windows 12 is expected to leverage AI chips more effectively.

Nvidia's new chip is versatile and can be utilized in various applications, such as generating images on Adobe Photoshop's Firefly generator or removing backgrounds in video calls. The company is also developing tools that allow game developers to integrate generative AI into their titles. For instance, AI could be used to generate dialogue for nonplayer characters, enhancing the gaming experience.

Nvidia's announcement positions the company to compete not only in the server GPU market but also in local AI alongside major players like Intel, AMD, and Qualcomm. These companies have also introduced specialized chips for AI PCs that facilitate machine learning tasks. The shift towards local AI reflects the industry's exploration of efficient deployment methods for generative AI, which requires significant computing power and can be costly to run on cloud services. Nvidia's proposal includes a hybrid approach, using cloud models for complex problems and local AI models for faster completion of latency-sensitive tasks.

The new graphics cards from Nvidia will comply with export controls and can be shipped to China, providing an alternative for Chinese researchers and companies that face challenges in accessing Nvidia's most powerful server GPUs.

In summary, Nvidia's focus on consumer GPUs for local AI applications demonstrates their commitment to expanding the use of AI beyond traditional gaming. By leveraging their GPUs' enhanced capabilities and collaborating with laptop manufacturers, Nvidia aims to capitalize on the growing demand for AI processing power. As the industry continues to explore optimal AI deployment methods, Nvidia's hybrid approach combining cloud and local AI models positions the company as a competitive player in this evolving market.
