# NVIDIA Introduces Microservices for Avatar Cloud Engine

LAS VEGAS, Jan. 08, 2024 - NVIDIA has announced the introduction of production microservices for its Avatar Cloud Engine (ACE) at CES. These microservices will enable game developers to integrate advanced generative AI models into digital avatars in their games and applications. The new ACE microservices offer developers the ability to create interactive avatars using AI models such as NVIDIA Omniverse Audio2Face and NVIDIA Riva automatic speech recognition. Prominent game and interactive avatar developers, including Ubisoft and Tencent, have already embraced ACE and its generative AI technologies. The introduction of ACE is expected to revolutionize NPC interactions and enhance player immersion in gaming experiences.

## Transforming NPC Interactions

Historically, NPCs have been designed with predetermined responses and limited facial animations. This has resulted in transactional and short-lived player interactions. However, ACE and generative AI technologies are set to change this. With the integration of NVIDIA Omniverse Audio2Face and NVIDIA Riva ASR, NPCs will be able to engage in realistic conversations with low-latency response times and high-fidelity natural animation. Additionally, NPCs will gain the ability to lead players to objectives and navigate game worlds with increased awareness of their surroundings.

## Pioneering Innovation in Gaming

NVIDIA's ACE has received significant support from top game developers who recognize its potential in improving player experiences. Zhipeng Hu, senior vice president of NetEase and head of LeiHuo business group, remarked that NVIDIA is making games more intelligent and playable through the adoption of gaming AI technologies. Tencent Games expressed excitement about the collaboration with NVIDIA ACE, noting that it will lay the foundation for creating digital avatars with lifelike personalities and interactions.

## Availability of ACE Microservices

Developers can now incorporate NVIDIA Omniverse Audio2Face and NVIDIA Riva ASR models into their development pipelines and begin creating interactive avatars with lifelike animation and speech. The ACE microservices are aimed at enhancing gaming experiences and delivering greater immersion for players.
