## summary

# Nvidia vs. Amazon: Which Tech Stock Offers Triple the Growth Potential?

The tech industry is renowned for its abundance of growth stocks that consistently deliver long-term gains. With the ever-expanding nature of technology, companies in this sector often reap the rewards of their innovation, providing reliable growth for investors. In fact, holding companies like Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway have allocated significant portions of their portfolios to tech stocks, resulting in substantial returns.

As we look ahead to the next two years, there are two tech giants that stand out in terms of their growth potential: Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Amazon (AMZN). Both companies are leading forces in the tech industry, but one may offer triple the stock growth compared to the other.

Nvidia is a chipmaker that powers various sectors of the industry, including artificial intelligence (AI), cloud platforms, video game consoles, and custom-built PCs. The company has experienced explosive growth in recent years, with its stock surging over 1,400% in the last five years and annual revenue rising by 130%. Nvidia's dominance in the GPU market, especially in industries that require GPUs like AI, has positioned the company for further success.

The increasing demand for AI has caused a surge in GPU requirements, and Nvidia is well-equipped to fulfill this need. This has resulted in a year-over-year stock increase of around 250% and impressive financials, with revenue growth of 206% in the third quarter of 2023. With the AI market projected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 37% through 2030, Nvidia's leading role in AI chips makes it a compelling investment.

Amazon, on the other hand, has established its presence in multiple sectors of the tech industry. While the company has achieved market dominance in e-commerce globally, its cloud platform known as Amazon Web Services (AWS) is a standout aspect of its business. AWS holds a 32% market share in the cloud market, outperforming competitors like Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud.

The cloud computing market is projected to experience robust growth, with a CAGR of 20% and a valuation of over $2 trillion. AWS has capitalized on this trend by adding a diverse range of AI tools and even venturing into chip production. Despite accounting for just 16% of Amazon's revenue, AWS contributes more than 60% to its operating income. This financial strength positions Amazon for long-term success in the highly profitable cloud computing business.

So, which tech stock offers triple the growth potential over the next two years? Based on earnings-per-share (EPS) estimates, Nvidia appears to be the better bet. With projected earnings of $24 per share, compared to Amazon's estimate of about $5 per share, Nvidia's stock has the potential to rise by 96% over the next two fiscal years. Amazon, while still impressive, is projected to see a 34% increase during the same period.

While both Nvidia and Amazon are formidable players in the tech industry, Nvidia's higher growth potential and dominant position in the booming chip business make it the superior tech stock for investors in the present time.
