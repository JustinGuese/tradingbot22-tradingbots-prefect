## summary

# Better Semiconductor Stock: Nvidia vs. AMD

Semiconductor stocks have been performing exceptionally well over the past year, with both Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) seeing significant gains. As the semiconductor industry is expected to experience accelerated growth in 2024, investors are wondering which of these two chip stocks is the better option. 

Nvidia, with its dominance in the AI chip market, is expected to experience faster growth over the next five years. The demand for chips used in AI servers and training large language models has remained strong, allowing Nvidia to generate impressive revenue. Investment bank UBS predicts that the market for AI graphics cards and chips could grow at an annual rate of 60% through 2027, reaching $165 billion in annual revenue. Nvidia is expected to maintain an 85% market share in this booming AI chip market in 2024. Additionally, the demand for Nvidia's graphics cards in gaming PCs is expected to increase with the turnaround in the market and the adoption of AI-enabled computers. Analysts forecast that Nvidia's total revenue could jump 56% in fiscal 2025 to $92 billion, with earnings increasing by 66% to $20.44 per share. 

In contrast, AMD relies more on selling CPUs, graphics cards, and semi-custom chips for PCs and gaming consoles. While AMD is positioned to capitalize on the recovery of the PC market and the market for AI-enabled PCs, its gaming segment may continue to weigh on its performance. AMD's revenue from gaming was down 8% in the third quarter of 2023 due to tepid sales of its semi-custom chips. With Nvidia holding an 80% share in gaming graphics cards, AMD may not be the best bet in this market. Furthermore, AMD's AI-focused business is still in its early stages, and its revenue from AI-related sales in 2024 is forecasted to be $2 billion, significantly lower than Nvidia's revenue. Analysts anticipate AMD's revenue to increase by 16.6% in 2024 to $26.4 billion, with earnings increasing by 41%.

Considering both the growth prospects and valuation, Nvidia appears to be the better semiconductor stock compared to AMD. Nvidia is expected to deliver faster growth, and its valuation is more attractive. As Nvidia's forward and trailing earnings multiples are lower than AMD's, investors looking to benefit from the semiconductor market's growth and trends such as AI may find Nvidia to be the better investment option.
