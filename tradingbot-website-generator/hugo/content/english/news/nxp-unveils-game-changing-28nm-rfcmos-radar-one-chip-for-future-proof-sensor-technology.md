# NXP Extends Industry-First Radar One-Chip Family for Software-Defined Vehicles

LAS VEGAS, Jan. 09, 2024 - NXP Semiconductors N.V. (NASDAQ: NXPI) has announced an extension of its automotive radar one-chip family, introducing the new SAF86xx monolithic chip. This chip is designed to enable advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) architectures for software-defined vehicles, providing a seamless transition from current smart sensors to future streaming sensors.

The SAF86xx chip integrates a high-performance radar transceiver, a multi-core radar processor, and a MACsec hardware engine for secure data communication over Automotive Ethernet. With NXP's S32 high-performance processors, vehicle network connectivity, and power management, this full system solution enables software-defined radar. It offers 360-degree sensor fusion, improved sensor resolution, and AI-based object classification.

The highly integrated radar System-on-Chip (SoC) is capable of streaming rich low-level radar sensor data at up to 1 Gbit/s. It allows car manufacturers to optimize ADAS partitioning for software-defined vehicles and supports Over-the-Air (OTA) updates, making it easy to introduce new software-defined radar features throughout the vehicle's lifetime.

Compared to prior-generation products, the SAF86xx chip leverages 28 nm RFCMOS performance, resulting in significantly improved radar sensor capabilities. It offers extended detection range beyond 300 meters, enhanced detection of small objects like curb stones, and improved detection of vulnerable road users such as cyclists and pedestrians. 

HELLA, a leading supplier of automotive electronics, will utilize NXP's SoC family as the foundation for its 7th generation radar portfolio, including variants for front, rear, corner, and side radar.

Dr. Dietmar Stapel, Vice President of Radar Program Management at HELLA, expressed confidence in the collaboration with NXP, stating, "With NXP's radar SoC family, we are now prepared to expand our market position and offer radar solutions for all relevant radar-supported functions, up to level 4 automated driving."

The new radar one-chip also supports important safety functions such as emergency braking and blind-spot detection. It enables advanced ADAS and autonomous driving applications, including traffic jam assist, highway pilot, park assist, and collision avoidance.

Steffen Spannagel, Senior Vice President and General Manager of ADAS at NXP Semiconductors, highlighted the benefits of the SAF86xx chip, stating, "A network of connected radar sensors with software-defined functions on a dedicated S32R radar processor in a distributed architecture can enhance radar-based perception to support advancements in autonomous driving. That includes 360-degree sensing, more powerful AI-based algorithms, and secure OTA software updates."

The comprehensive SAF8xxx family, which includes the new SAF86xx and SAF85xx chips, can be customized for individual OEM use cases. It supports a range of sensor outputs and is compatible with both current smart sensor architectures and future distributed architectures.

NXP's new SAF86xx radar family builds upon its suite of radar sensor solutions designed to enhance vehicle safety. The suite covers various use cases and architectures, from corner radar to high-resolution 4D imaging radar. The S32R platform offers a common architecture for software reuse, high-performance hardware security, OTA update support, and compliance with the latest cybersecurity standards.

NXP's SAF86xx radar SoC family is currently sampling for alpha customers. For more information, please visit [www.nxp.com/saf86xx](www.nxp.com/saf86xx).
