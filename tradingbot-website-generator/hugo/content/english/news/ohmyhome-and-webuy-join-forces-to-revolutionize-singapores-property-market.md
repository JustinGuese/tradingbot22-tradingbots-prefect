# Ohmyhome and Webuy Forge Partnership to Elevate Property and E-Commerce Services in Singapore

Ohmyhome Ltd. (OMH) and Webuy Global Ltd. (WBUY) have announced a strategic collaboration to cross-sell their distinct services in Singapore. The partnership aims to enhance customer experience and community engagement by leveraging each other's strengths and offerings.

Webuy will integrate Ohmyhome's property listing, renovation, and other services into its community e-commerce platform and Group Leaders. This integration will allow Group Leaders to offer Ohmyhome's property listings and services to their respective community members, facilitating unique off-market opportunities and exclusive perks.

In return, Webuy will introduce its 'group buy' service to Ohmyhome's homeowner base, providing a wide range of products from groceries to travel deals. As part of Webuy's Online-to-Offline (O2O) strategy, Ohmyhome will assist in establishing new retail fronts. Webuy has set an ambitious goal of opening 100 stores across key Singaporean locales, expanding its retail footprint.

Rhonda Wong, CEO and Co-founder of Ohmyhome, expressed excitement about the collaboration, stating, "This partnership allows both companies to leverage our respective broad customer bases, increasing our reach and complementing each other's service offerings centered around homes and communities."

In the stock market, OMH shares are trading higher by 1.32% at $1.54, and WBUY is up 0.95% at $0.53 on the last check Monday.
