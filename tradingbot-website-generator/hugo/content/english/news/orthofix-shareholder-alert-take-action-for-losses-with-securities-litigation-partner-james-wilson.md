# Orthofix Shareholder Alert

**New York, New York--(Newsfile Corp. - January 13, 2024) -** Securities Litigation Partner James (Josh) Wilson is urging investors who have suffered significant losses in Orthofix Medical Inc. ("Orthofix" or the "Company") (NASDAQ: OFIX) to contact him directly to discuss their options. Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP, a leading national securities law firm, is conducting an investigation into potential claims against Orthofix.

On September 12, 2023, Orthofix announced that its independent directors had unanimously decided to terminate Chief Executive Officer Keith Valentine, Chief Financial Officer John Bostjancic, and Chief Legal Officer Patrick Keran for cause. The company also requested that Mr. Valentine resign from the Board. This decision was made following an investigation conducted by independent outside legal counsel, overseen by the independent directors, which found that each of the executives had engaged in conduct that violated multiple code of conduct requirements and was inconsistent with the company's values and culture.

As a result of this news, Orthofix's share price declined by $5.62, or 30.2%, closing at $13.01 per share on September 12, 2023, which caused significant losses for investors.
