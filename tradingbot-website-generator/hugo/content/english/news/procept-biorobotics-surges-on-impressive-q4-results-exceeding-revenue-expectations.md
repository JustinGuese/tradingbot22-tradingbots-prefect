# Procept BioRobotics Shares Are Higher Today, CEO Touts 'Strong Surgeon Interest'

Procept BioRobotics Corp (PRCT) shares are trading higher after the company announced its preliminary fourth-quarter (Q4) FY23 results yesterday. The company expects Q4 revenues to be in the range of $43.3 million to $43.6 million, surpassing the consensus estimate of $41.48 million.

In particular, Procept BioRobotics anticipates U.S. revenue to be between $40 million and $40.3 million, with approximately 6,400 handpieces sold, resulting in a monthly utilization rate of about 7.3. The San Jose, California-based firm also expects U.S. service revenue of around $2.1 million and international revenue of approximately $3.3 million in Q4.

Looking ahead, Procept BioRobotics projects its revenue for FY23 to be in the range of $135.9 million to $136.2 million, representing a year-over-year growth of approximately 81% to 82%. The company attributes this growth to the outstanding real-world clinical outcomes of its Aquablation Therapy, a strong sales team, and increasing interest from surgeons, leading to rapid adoption within urology practices.

Reza Zadno, the Chief Executive Officer of Procept BioRobotics, stated, "As we enter 2024, we are well positioned to continue to deliver outsized revenue growth driven by outstanding real-world clinical outcomes of Aquablation Therapy, the largest and most tenured capital sales team in the company's history, and strong surgeon interest leading to rapid adoption within urology practices."

Procept BioRobotics plans to release its Q4 and FY23 results on February 27, 2024.

As of the last check on Tuesday, PRCT shares were up 7.06% at $45.19.
