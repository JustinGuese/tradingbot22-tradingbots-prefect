# 51% of Americans Retire at Age 61 or Earlier. These 2 Stocks Could Get You There Sooner.

In a recent survey, 62% of Americans said they consider retirement to be part of the American dream. The idea of enjoying your golden years and spending time pursuing passions and hobbies is enticing for many. However, most people want to retire as early as possible to make the most of their newfound freedom. According to Motley Fool Research, 51% of Americans retire by age 61, and 23% retire between ages 62 and 64.

If you're looking to retire early, there are two stocks that could potentially help you get there even sooner: The Trade Desk (NASDAQ: TTD) and Cava Group (NASDAQ: CAVA).

First up is The Trade Desk, one of the leading demand-side platforms in the ad tech industry. The company operates in the digital advertising market, which is projected to continue growing in the coming years. As traditional media markets shift to digital media, the addressable market for digital advertising is estimated to be worth $1 trillion globally. The Trade Desk has a proven track record of outperformance and offers a cloud-based platform for ad agencies to manage digital ad campaigns. It has consistently posted high customer satisfaction rates and boasts a customer retention rate of 95% or greater for over nine years. Despite the recent slowdown in the advertising industry, The Trade Desk has managed to outgrow its competition and gain market share. With new technologies like AI-based Kokai platform and Unified ID 2.0 protocol, the company is well-positioned to capitalize on the recovery in digital advertising demand. Furthermore, the stock is currently down 38% from its peak in 2021, making it an attractive investment opportunity.

Next is Cava Group, a Mediterranean fast-casual chain that has been compared to the highly successful Chipotle Mexican Grill. Cava Group has a strong management team led by Ron Shaich, the founder of Panera Bread and Au Bon Pain. The company has experienced rapid growth and delivers impressive financial results. In the third quarter of 2023, Cava Group reported a 50% increase in revenue, driven by 14.1% same-store sales growth and continued expansion. Additionally, the company achieved a restaurant-level profit margin of 25.1%, similar to that of Chipotle. Cava Group operates a concept similar to Chipotle, offering Mediterranean food in bowls and pitas, and has successfully capitalized on the digital sales channel, with 36% of its revenue coming from online orders. The stock is currently priced at a reasonable price-to-sales ratio of 7, suggesting it has significant growth potential.

While these stocks carry their own risks and investors should conduct thorough research before making any investment decisions, The Trade Desk and Cava Group have strong growth prospects and could potentially help investors retire early.
