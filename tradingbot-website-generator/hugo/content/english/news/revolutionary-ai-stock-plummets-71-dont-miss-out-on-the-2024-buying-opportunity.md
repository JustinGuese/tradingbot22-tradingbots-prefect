## summary

# This unique cloud company is bringing artificial intelligence to small businesses

Not every artificial intelligence (AI) stock soared to a new all-time high in 2023. However, DigitalOcean, a provider of cloud services, is entering the AI industry and preparing to scale its cloud AI offerings for small and mid-size businesses. The company's stock looks very attractive in light of this development.

DigitalOcean specializes in providing cloud services to small and mid-size businesses (SMBs), tailoring its offering to suit their specific needs. With transparent pricing, personalized service, and an educational library, DigitalOcean aims to cater to SMBs in a way that larger cloud providers cannot.

In its efforts to bring artificial intelligence to small businesses, DigitalOcean acquired Paperspace for $111 million in July 2023. Paperspace offers a range of GPUs designed for AI workloads at prices that can be up to 70% cheaper than major cloud providers.

A recent survey conducted by DigitalOcean found that 43% of developers and SMBs currently use AI and machine learning, with 78% planning to increase their use of these tools in 2024. This suggests a significant growth potential for DigitalOcean in the AI market.

While DigitalOcean's official financial results for 2023 will be reported in February, Wall Street expects its revenue to increase by almost 20% compared to the prior year. With the company's focus on profitability and the potential for accelerated growth through AI, DigitalOcean stock is currently trading at an attractive price-to-sales multiple.

In conclusion, DigitalOcean's entry into the AI industry and its targeted approach to serving small businesses position the company for potential growth. With the integration of Paperspace underway, investors may see results in the coming quarters. At its current valuation, DigitalOcean stock presents an opportunity for investors.
