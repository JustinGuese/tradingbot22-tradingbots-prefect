# At a 2024 Consumer Electronics Show, AI Gets Companies on the Same Page

Companies big and small showcased new AI-powered products and their AI-inspired visions for the future at the world's biggest tech convention, the Consumer Electronics Show (CES), held in Las Vegas this week. From snore-reducing pillows to mood-detecting mirrors, the announcements at this year's CES indicated a significant shift in focus towards artificial intelligence. According to market research firm Forrester, nearly every company appeared to be on the same page when it came to embracing AI due to its infinite possibilities and wide-ranging applications. Previous themes lacked the universal appeal that AI currently holds.

CES, known for its dealmaking between executives, manufacturers, and retailers, often sets the stage for major tech trends and highlights how companies plan to integrate themselves into these trends. This year, notable non-tech companies such as Walmart and L'Oreal delivered keynote presentations discussing their AI visions, which primarily revolved around incorporating generative AI solutions to enhance customer product searches. Amazon also provided updates on how some developers are integrating similar technology with their Alexa voice assistant. Automakers like Volkswagen announced their plans to integrate the viral chatbot ChatGPT into their car lineups to assist drivers with navigation, infotainment systems, and other features.

According to Dipanjan Chatterjee, an analyst at Forrester, these announcements demonstrate a new approach where companies prioritize customer needs and then find ways to utilize technology to meet those needs. This shift indicates a departure from showcasing cool technology without a clear use case.

This year's CES also witnessed a broader transformation in the convention's focus, shifting from technology powering experiences to experiences powered by technology. Chipmakers Nvidia and AMD unveiled new processors designed to support the next generation of AI products, furthering this transition. Jitesh Ubrani from market research firm IDC noted that this year's chatter surrounding CES felt distinct, as companies have a growing understanding of how seamlessly AI will integrate into our lives in the coming years. As companies strive not to be left behind, they are increasingly investing in AI before fully fleshing out all potential products and use cases.

Beyond AI, other products also caught attention. Samsung unveiled the world's first transparent MicroLED screen, resembling a floating sheet of glass. EssilorLuxottica showcased its Nuance Audio eyeglasses, featuring built-in hearing aids, and Sony teased a mixed reality headset controlled by a smart ring.

Despite the widespread integration of AI at CES 2024, Eric Abbruzzese, a director at market research firm ABI Research, acknowledges the need for potential regulations in the AI space. As government bodies and the White House address the rapid evolution of technology, companies will need to adapt their messaging should regulation or negative events related to AI arise. AI's dominance, not only in tech but across industries, is expected to continue throughout the year and beyond, with its true impact yet to be fully realized.

In summary, the Consumer Electronics Show 2024 demonstrated a unified focus on artificial intelligence among companies of all sizes. From major tech players to traditional retailers, businesses showcased their AI-powered products and outlined how AI will shape their future endeavors. This shift reflects the recognition of AI's limitless possibilities and the desire not to be left behind in this rapidly evolving landscape. While AI dominated the conversations at CES 2024, other notable developments also garnered attention, signaling an industry-wide commitment to technological innovation.
