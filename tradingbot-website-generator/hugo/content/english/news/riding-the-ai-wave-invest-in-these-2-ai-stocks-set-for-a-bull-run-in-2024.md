## summary

# Some AI Stocks are Slated to Continue their Momentum into 2024

Many artificial intelligence (AI) stocks had a strong run in 2023 and are still moving higher in 2024. Two AI stocks, Super Micro Computer and DocuSign, are expected to continue their momentum and potentially become top performers in the market.

**1. Super Micro Computer**

Super Micro Computer, also known as Supermicro, had a phenomenal year in 2023, gaining 246% and outperforming AI giant Nvidia. Supermicro manufactures servers that house the graphics processing units (GPUs) sold by Nvidia. As companies increase their computing capabilities and demand for AI deep learning, engineering simulations, drug discovery, and game development grows, Supermicro stands to benefit.

Although the stock has become more expensive compared to historical averages, it's important to consider the company's growth potential. Supermicro's revenue is expected to expand throughout FY 2024, with management increasing its revenue guidance from $10 billion to $10.5 billion. This growth trajectory aligns with the company's vision of reaching $20 billion in annual revenue, nearly triple last year's levels. Considering these factors, Super Micro Computer is expected to continue its bull run throughout 2024.

**2. DocuSign**

DocuSign, a digital agreement platform, has faced challenges after reaching its all-time high in 2021 and experiencing a significant decline. However, the company has the potential for recovery, especially with the integration of AI tools into its offerings.

DocuSign's AI tools, including a generative AI product that creates contractual agreements, have the capacity to save time and money for businesses. By automating the contract creation process, companies can minimize the need for legal review and increase efficiency. DocuSign's Q3 of FY 2024 showed a 9% year-over-year revenue increase, and management has expressed optimism about delivering strong results in FY 2025.

Despite recent setbacks, DocuSign is currently priced at attractive levels. If the company's investment in AI tools proves successful, it could become a top-performing AI stock in 2024.
