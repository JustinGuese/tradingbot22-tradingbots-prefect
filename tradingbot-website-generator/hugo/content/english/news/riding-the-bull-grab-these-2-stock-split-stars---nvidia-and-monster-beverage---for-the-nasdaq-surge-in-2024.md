## summary

## Nvidia and Monster Beverage Poised for Growth as Bull Runs Continue

Nvidia and Monster Beverage are experiencing impressive upward trends in their stock prices, and experts believe there is still room for growth. Both companies have a history of stock splits, which are often indicative of a company's growing success.

Nvidia, known for its graphics processing units (GPUs), has conducted five stock splits in recent years. Its most recent split occurred in July 2021, with a conversion of 4-for-1. Despite the significant growth in Nvidia's stock price, experts suggest that it may not be too late for investors to get on board.

Nvidia's success can be attributed to its ability to capitalize on new technologies faster than its competitors. Its GPUs, initially designed for video game visuals, found another use in cryptocurrency mining. The company's focus has now shifted to generative artificial intelligence (AI), which has driven its revenue up by 206% year over year in the third quarter to $18.1 billion. With the AI training hardware market expected to expand to $400 billion by 2027, Nvidia has ample opportunity for continued growth.

While competition is expected to increase in the AI sector, Nvidia's advantage lies in its speed to market. Its strong developer community has built software and servers around its hardware, making it less likely for them to switch to less-compatible alternatives.

Monster Beverage, a popular energy drink maker, has also seen significant stock price growth over the past decade. The company has split its stock six times, with the most recent conversion occurring in March 2023. Despite its $60 billion market capitalization, Monster Beverage continues to demonstrate strong business momentum.

While net sales increased by 14.3% year over year to $1.9 billion, the company experienced exceptional growth in its new alcohol business. Sales in this segment jumped by 58% to $42.3 million following the introduction of new products, such as The Beast Unleashed line of malt alcohol drinks. By leveraging its existing supply chains and distribution networks, Monster Beverage has successfully diversified its operations.

With a slightly higher forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 31 compared to the Nasdaq-100 average of 28, Monster Beverage may appear slightly more expensive. However, the premium is justified by its strong bottom-line momentum, with third-quarter net income increasing by 40% year over year to $452 million.

While historical patterns and stock splits may provide confidence for investors, it is crucial to consider the fundamentals when making investment decisions. Both Nvidia and Monster Beverage have displayed strong past performance, and their focus on new technologies and ability to capitalize on market trends make them attractive options for long-term investors.
