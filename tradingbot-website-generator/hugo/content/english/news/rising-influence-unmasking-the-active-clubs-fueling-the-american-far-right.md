# Far-Right Groups in the United States Growing Steadily, Embracing Extremist Ideologies

Far-right groups in the United States are experiencing a steady growth, with ideologies once considered fringe now becoming "normal and acceptable," according to a report by the New Republic. These groups are increasingly associated with white supremacist, anti-LGBTQ+, and even antisemitic conspiracy theories. The rise of these extremist ideologies has led to a surge in violence, as revealed by data from The Economist, which showed that all 25 extremist-related murders in the U.S. in 2022 were linked to the far-right.

Within the far-right movement, there is a particular emphasis on white nationalist "active clubs." These decentralized groups engage in combat training and distribute material that promotes racist rhetoric. Active clubs are inspired by a Southern California white supremacist organization known as the Rise Above Movement. Their aim is to combat what they perceive as a system plotting against the white race. These groups organize MMA-style events, combining fitness and nationalist activism to foster camaraderie and develop team-building skills.

Active clubs also utilize social media platforms to disseminate their beliefs. They blend traditional fitness and martial arts imagery with white supremacist flags, symbols, and messages. The number of active clubs is challenging to determine due to their decentralized nature. However, a September 2023 report from the Counter Extremism Project identified 46 active clubs in the United States, with significant presence in Canada and Europe as well.

What sets active clubs apart from other white nationalist groups is their lack of hierarchical structure. They operate as locally run cells that share a common ethos. This decentralized model offers resilience, as the arrest of one leader does not disrupt the entire network. Additionally, active clubs present a more polished and presentable image, focusing on physical fitness, self-improvement, and "white unity" to attract new members.

Notably, active clubs are also changing the perception of women within white nationalist movements. While traditional white supremacist groups have often confined women to traditional roles, active clubs portray women as fighters and activists. The inclusion of women as "fighters" aims to enhance the group's image and expand its audience beyond the typical hypermasculine marketing.

Active clubs seek to mainstream their ideas and ideologies to gain broader acceptance within society. They operate as a far-right countercultural movement. While their neo-Nazi roots may be less visible, active clubs often maintain ties to neo-Nazi movements and exhibit pro-Nazi rhetoric on social media. As a "standby militia" of violent martial arts fighters, active clubs are poised to engage in larger-scale coordinated violent actions when the need arises.

The growth of these active clubs coincides with the decline or decimation of other far-right groups, such as the Oath Keepers and the Proud Boys. Their explosive growth is indicative of a shift within the far-right movement, presenting themselves as the embodiment of what groups like the Proud Boys aspired to be.

The proliferation of these active clubs raises concerns about the spread of extremist ideologies and the potential for increased violence. Countermeasures must be implemented to address the root causes that contribute to the rise and acceptance of these dangerous ideologies within American society.
