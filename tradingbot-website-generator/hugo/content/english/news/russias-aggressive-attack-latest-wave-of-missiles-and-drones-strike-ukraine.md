# Russia Unleashes Fresh Barrage of Missiles and Drones Against Ukraine

*Kyiv, January 13, 2024 -* In a relentless display of aggression, Russia has launched yet another wave of missile and drone attacks against Ukraine. This marks the fourth major assault since December 29, raising concerns that Moscow intends to overwhelm Ukraine's air defense capabilities.

According to the Ukrainian Air Force, the Russian onslaught consisted of 40 attack weapons, including cruise, aeroballistic, ballistic, aircraft, and anti-aircraft guided missiles, as well as strike unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Despite the intensity of the attack, Ukraine claims to have successfully intercepted and brought down eight missiles. They also stated that over 20 air attack weapons failed to reach their intended targets due to effective electronic warfare countermeasures.

The air raid warnings were activated throughout the country, with several regions, including Chernihiv in northern Ukraine and Dnipro in the east, experiencing the direct impact of the attacks. In Chernihiv, missile fragments caused damage to unoccupied civilian residential buildings, although thankfully no injuries were reported. The local mayor attributed the lack of casualties to the previous damage in the area. Similarly, in Dnipro, there were incoming hits, but the head of the Dnipropetrovsk region military administration assured the public that everyone was safe, although the extent of the damage is still being assessed.

Russia's Ministry of Defense claimed that the aerial barrage successfully struck Ukrainian military industrial complex facilities, achieving its intended goal. These attacks on January 13 are the fourth large-scale assaults since December 29, as Russia continues its aggressive tactics against Ukraine.

Analysts believe that Russia's recent missile onslaught aims to overload Ukraine's limited missile defense capabilities. In a previous attack on January 7, Ukraine was only able to shoot down 18 out of 59 launched missiles. Moreover, the Russian military has adapted its tactics during the aerial campaign, such as painting their Iranian-made drones black to camouflage them against the night sky. Additionally, some drones have had their engine exhausts moved to the front, confusing anti-air batteries that rely on thermal sights.

Ukraine's President, Volodymyr Zelensky, acknowledged during a press conference that the country still lacks comprehensive air cover and appropriate systems to counter ballistic missiles. Although some progress has been made, including agreements on new systems, Ukraine continues to face challenges due to limited resources. As a result, the country heavily relies on mobile firing groups for air defenses, aiming to save guided anti-aircraft missiles, which are in short supply, under the current massive attacks.

As tensions between Russia and Ukraine escalate, the international community is closely monitoring the situation, with concerns growing about the potential for further violence and its impact on regional stability.
