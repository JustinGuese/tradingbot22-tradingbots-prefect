# Sam Altman Reveals His Go-To App â€” And, Surprisingly, It's Not ChatGPT

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has recently shared his most-used app during an "Unconfuse Me" podcast episode with Bill Gates. Contrary to expectations, Altman revealed that his go-to app is Slack, not ChatGPT, the AI sensation developed by his company. Altman uses Slack for daily communications and considers it his most frequently used app. Following closely is iMessage. In a humorous remark, Altman mentioned that he wishes he could say ChatGPT is his top app choice. 

This is an interesting revelation given that OpenAI has received a $10 billion investment from Microsoft Corp. Despite this partnership, Altman and his team use Google Meet over Microsoft Teams for meetings. 

During the podcast episode, Gates also shared his preferred apps, naming Outlook and web browsers as his top tools. Gates emphasized his preference for traditional digital communication methods, stating that he is an "old-style email guy" and relies on web browsers for news. 

The conversation between Altman and Gates also touched on the rapid evolution of artificial intelligence and its potential impact on society. Altman expressed concerns about how individuals and job markets need to adapt quickly to AI advancements. He highlighted the speed at which technological revolutions are occurring and the challenges they pose for society and the labor market.

Altman also reflected on a significant growth moment for OpenAI, describing a brief departure from the company as a turning point. The incident, which was quickly reversed following pushback from Microsoft and OpenAI staff, led to a more focused and optimistic outlook for the future of the company.
