## summary

SEC Chair Gary Gensler has confirmed that the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is taking the recent cybersecurity incident seriously. He stated that there is currently no evidence to suggest that the unauthorized party who gained access to the SEC's X account on January 9th had accessed any other systems, data, devices, or social media accounts. Gensler emphasized that the SEC is evaluating the impact of the breach on crypto investors, agencies, and marketplaces.

The SEC recognizes the concerns about the security of its social media accounts and will continue to assess whether additional remedial measures are necessary. The agency is working closely with law enforcement and security agencies, including the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Department of Homeland Security's Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, to investigate the incident.

According to Gensler, the unauthorized party took control of the official SECGov X account using its phone number on January 9th and posted that the SEC had approved a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF). The SEC contacted X for assistance in terminating the unauthorized access, which was reported to have been terminated between 4:40 pm ET and 5:30 pm ET.

Gensler clarified that the SEC does not use X or any other social media platform to announce any development. In response to the incident, Senators Ron Wyden and Cynthia Lummis have urged the SEC Inspector General to launch a probe into the commission's cybersecurity practices.

This incident highlights the importance of robust cybersecurity measures in the crypto industry, as breaches can have significant implications for investors, marketplaces, and regulatory agencies. As the SEC continues its investigation, it is crucial for all stakeholders to remain vigilant and take appropriate steps to enhance their cybersecurity defenses.
