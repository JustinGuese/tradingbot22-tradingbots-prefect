## summary

Steel Dynamics, one of the largest steel companies in North America, is gaining attention for its impressive dividend growth. However, it was the company's recent earnings guidance update that surprised Wall Street.

The steel industry is known for its cyclical nature, and Steel Dynamics has taken the proactive approach of providing earnings guidance updates before its actual earnings releases. This time, Wall Street's predictions were way off the mark, and it turned out to be good news for the company.

Despite being a relative upstart compared to industry icons like United States Steel and Nucor, Steel Dynamics has experienced significant growth since its establishment. What sets it apart is its impressive dividend growth. Over the past 13 years, the company has consistently increased its dividend at an annualized rate of 16%, compared to Nucor's annualized growth rate of roughly 3%.

Steel Dynamics surprised Wall Street with its recent earnings guidance update. While the steel sector has been facing challenges with volume and prices, the company's update revealed better-than-expected performance. For the fourth quarter of 2023, Steel Dynamics expects earnings in the range of $2.60 to $2.64 per share, higher than analysts' predictions of around $2.46 per share. This announcement had a positive impact on the company's stock price.

The company's ability to execute well in a challenging operating environment is commendable. While Steel Dynamics' current dividend yield of 1.5% may not be considered a bargain, dividend growth investors should keep an eye on the stock. During the next recession, when steel stocks are likely to face selling pressure, Steel Dynamics could present an opportunity for investors to buy at attractive prices.

Overall, Steel Dynamics' impressive dividend growth and better-than-expected earnings guidance update highlight the company's strong performance. As a result, dividend growth investors may find this stock worth watching.
