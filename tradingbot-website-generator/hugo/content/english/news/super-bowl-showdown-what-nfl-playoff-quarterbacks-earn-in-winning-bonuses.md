# NFL Playoffs: How Much Quarterbacks Make in Super Bowl Bonuses

Nine NFL playoff quarterbacks are vying for the top prize in the sport - a Super Bowl victory. But for many of these quarterbacks, there's more than just glory on the line. They also have the opportunity to earn a bonus if their team emerges victorious. These bonuses are part of their contracts and offer a chance to boost their earnings based on their performance throughout the season.

Cincinnati Bengals running back Joe Mixon is one example of a player who unlocked a $350,000 bonus by scoring his 12th touchdown of the season in the last week of the regular season. But it's not just regular-season milestones that can earn players extra money. Many quarterbacks have incentives tied to their performance in the playoffs, including the Super Bowl. Here's a breakdown of how much each of the nine NFL playoff quarterbacks will receive if they win the Super Bowl:

9. **Brock Purdy** - Purdy and the San Francisco 49ers are the current Super Bowl favorites, according to DraftKings. In 2022, Purdy signed a four-year contract with an average annual salary of about $934,000. If the 49ers win the Super Bowl, Purdy will earn an additional $164,000.

8. **Baker Mayfield** - Mayfield and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers have the 12th-best Super Bowl odds. In 2023, Mayfield signed a one-year, $4 million contract. If Tampa Bay emerges victorious, Mayfield will receive an extra $250,000.

7. **Jalen Hurts** - Hurts and the Philadelphia Eagles have the sixth-best Super Bowl odds. Hurts recently signed a contract extension with an average annual salary of $51 million. If the Eagles win the Super Bowl, Hurts will earn an additional $500,000.

6. **Jared Goff** - Goff and the Detroit Lions have the eighth-best Super Bowl odds. Goff signed a four-year contract in 2019 worth an average annual salary of nearly $34 million. If the Lions win the Super Bowl, Goff will earn an extra $945,000.

5. **Jordan Love** - Love and the Green Bay Packers have the 13th-best Super Bowl odds. Last May, Love signed a contract extension that guarantees him at least $9.8 million in 2023. If the Packers win the Super Bowl, Love will receive an additional $1 million.

5. **Dak Prescott** - Prescott and the Dallas Cowboys have the fourth-best Super Bowl odds. In 2021, Prescott signed an extension with an average annual salary of $40 million. If Dallas wins the Super Bowl and Prescott plays at least 50% of the offensive snaps, he will earn an extra $1 million.

3. **Patrick Mahomes** - Mahomes and the Kansas City Chiefs have the fifth-best Super Bowl odds. In September, Mahomes agreed to a restructured deal with an average annual salary of nearly $53 million. If the Chiefs win the Super Bowl and Mahomes plays at least 50% of the offensive snaps, he will earn an additional $1.25 million.

2. **Joe Flacco** - Flacco and the Cleveland Browns have the ninth-best Super Bowl odds. Flacco signed a one-year, $2.5 million contract in December. If the Browns win the Super Bowl, Flacco will receive an extra $2 million. He also has the opportunity to earn additional bonuses for victories in the three preceding games.

1. **Josh Allen** - Allen and the Buffalo Bills have the third-best Super Bowl odds. In 2021, Allen signed a contract extension with an average annual salary of over $43 million. If the Bills win the Super Bowl and Allen plays at least 60% of the offensive snaps, he will earn an extra $2.5 million.

These bonuses provide an additional incentive for quarterbacks to perform at their best during the playoffs and strive for the ultimate goal of winning the Super Bowl.
