# Taiwan voters dismiss China warnings and hand ruling party a historic third consecutive presidential win

Taiwan's ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) achieved a significant feat on Saturday as they won a historic third consecutive presidential election, despite warnings from China about the potential risks of re-electing the party. Vice President Lai Ching-te, the DPP candidate, declared victory in the evening, with both of his opposition rivals conceding defeat. Lai addressed his jubilant supporters, stating, "This is a night that belongs to Taiwan. We managed to keep Taiwan on the map of the world." He also emphasized the commitment of Taiwanese people to democracy and hoped that China would understand this sentiment. China responded by asserting that "Taiwan is part of China." The counting of votes has concluded, and Lai received just over 40% of the votes, according to Taiwan's Central Election Commission. The opposition Kuomintang party candidate, Hou Yu-ih, secured 33.49% of the votes, and Ko Wen-je, the candidate from the Taiwan People's Party, received 26.45%. The voter turnout was over 71%, reflecting the active participation of Taiwanese citizens in the democratic process. 

The election campaign was marked by issues regarding livelihoods and how to deal with China. Taiwan, a vibrant democracy, faced the challenge of navigating its relationship with its powerful and assertive neighbor. The election result shows that voters overwhelmingly support the DPP's stance, viewing Taiwan as a de facto sovereign country that must strengthen its defense against China's threats and forge closer ties with other democratic nations, even at the cost of potential economic punishment or military intimidation from Beijing. This result is another blow to China's attempts to assert control over Taiwan, as it demonstrates that the Taiwanese people are firmly committed to their democratic values and self-determination. 

Following the election, China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs reaffirmed its position that "Taiwan is part of China" and stated that the one-China principle is crucial for peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait. However, other world powers, including the United States, have congratulated Lai on his victory. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken acknowledged the strength of Taiwan's democratic system and electoral process. 

Lai's victory is unlikely to lead to any improvement in the strained relationship between Beijing and Taipei. China cut off most communications with Taiwan after President Tsai Ing-wen took office and increased diplomatic, economic, and military pressure on the island. China considers Taiwan as part of its territory, although it has never governed it. The DPP firmly believes that Taiwan's future should be determined by its 23.5 million people, rejecting the Chinese Communist Party's authority over the island. In the lead-up to the
