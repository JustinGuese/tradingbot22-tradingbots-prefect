## summary

# Rising Number of Electric Vehicles Delivered by Tesla Indicates Global Traction

The number of electric vehicles (EV) delivered by Tesla has been steadily increasing, with 1.8 million vehicles delivered last year compared to 1.3 million in 2022. This rise in deliveries is a clear indication of the growing popularity and global traction of electric vehicles. While the annual growth rate is expected to slow down, the market for EVs continues to expand.

According to BloombergNEF, passenger EV sales are projected to reach 16.7 million in 2024, up from nearly 14 million in the previous year. This means that one in every five passenger cars sold worldwide this year will be electric. The two leading manufacturers in the EV market are Tesla and China's BYD.

In India, electric car sales reached close to the 100,000-vehicle mark last year, showcasing the increasing adoption of electric vehicles in the country.

While the growth rate may slow down, the continued expansion of the EV market is a positive sign for the industry. As more countries and consumers embrace sustainable technologies, the demand for electric vehicles is expected to rise further.
