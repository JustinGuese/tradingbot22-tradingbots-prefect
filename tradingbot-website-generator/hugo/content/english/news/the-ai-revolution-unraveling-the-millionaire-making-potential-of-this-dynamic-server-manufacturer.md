# A Lesser-Known Server Manufacturer Emerges as an AI Stock with Millionaire-Maker Potential

*By Will Healy â€“ Jan 13, 2024 at 5:45AM*

A lesser-known server manufacturer has recently gained attention in the investment world, thanks to its involvement in the field of artificial intelligence (AI). Super Micro Computer (SMCI) has emerged as a potential millionaire-maker stock, with its unique specialization in both hardware and software integration.

Super Micro, which has been in operation for more than 30 years, is a leading manufacturer of servers and other IT solutions. It stands out from its competitors by combining hardware and software expertise, an advantage in the era of increasing AI adoption. While most tech companies specialize in either hardware or software, Super Micro's ability to seamlessly integrate both positions it well for future growth.

The company has also established itself globally, with a customer base in over 100 countries and extensive manufacturing facilities spanning 6 million square feet. Additionally, Super Micro focuses on environmentally friendly products that prioritize energy savings, further enhancing its competitive edge.

Investors have started to take notice of Super Micro's potential, driving the stock price up by approximately 300% over the past year. The company's market capitalization now stands at around $18 billion, reflecting the growing recognition of its prospects.

While Super Micro's increased market cap may limit its potential to create millionaires to some extent, there is still room for significant growth. For instance, a 100-fold increase in market cap would put it in the league of mega-tech companies. Moreover, the data center market is projected to reach $437 billion by 2030, with an annual growth rate of 11%. This ongoing market expansion presents substantial opportunities for Super Micro.

In terms of financial performance, Super Micro experienced a revenue increase of 14% in the first quarter of fiscal 2024, following a 37% rise in fiscal 2023. The company has been investing in research and development as well as sales and marketing, leading to momentarily reduced net income in the most recent quarter. However, with profits growing by 125% in fiscal 2023 and an upward revision in revenue guidance for fiscal 2024, Super Micro's prospects remain promising.

Furthermore, Super Micro's price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) sits at around 31, indicating a relatively low valuation compared to its earnings growth. The price-to-sales ratio (P/S) is also attractive at only 2.5, especially when compared to industry peers such as Nvidia and Microsoft with significantly higher sales multiples. These favorable valuation metrics suggest substantial upside potential for the stock once more investors recognize Super Micro's growth prospects.

In summary, Super Micro Computer presents an opportunity as a potential millionaire-maker stock, thanks to its unique combination of hardware and software specialization. Despite the recent surge in its market cap, the company's involvement in AI and its low valuation ratios make it an attractive investment option. As AI adoption continues to rise, Super Micro's growth potential remains significant.
