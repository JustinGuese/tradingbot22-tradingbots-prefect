## summary

# Forget Celsius Holdings: This Stock Has Made Far More Millionaires

Fitness-focused energy drink maker Celsius Holdings (NASDAQ: CELH) has gained significant attention in the market as it has created a fair number of millionaires in the last four years. The stock has experienced a staggering 3,700% gain since taking its flagship beverage brand nationwide in March 2000. However, despite its success, Celsius Holdings is not among the 100 most owned stocks on the Robinhood Markets brokerage today and there is no evidence that it has ever ranked on that indicator of investor interest. Additionally, there are 650 companies with larger market caps than Celsius Holdings' $13.8 billion, making it clear that the company is not yet an industry giant. 

While it is still early innings for Celsius Holdings' long-term growth game, there is another stock that has proven to be even more lucrative for investors. Netflix Inc. (NASDAQ: NFLX) has outperformed Celsius Holdings in terms of generating wealth for investors. Netflix's stock has made far more millionaires, and it is currently trading at €449.30 per share with a slight increase of 0.07%. With 44 Buy ratings and 7 Sell ratings, there is a positive sentiment surrounding Netflix Inc. Aktie. Analysts believe that it has a potential upside of 1.49% compared to its current price of €449.30. 

In conclusion, while Celsius Holdings has gained significant attention for its wealth-generating potential, it still has a long way to go to match the success of other players in the market. Netflix Inc. has proven to be a more lucrative investment, with a larger number of millionaires and a stronger market position. Investors should consider the growth potential and track record of both companies before making any investment decisions.
