## summary

# These Buffett Stocks Are Built for the Long Run

Investing in stocks for the long term can be a profitable strategy, especially when following the lead of successful investors like Warren Buffett. Buffett's portfolio offers several great ideas for long-term investors, and here are the three best Buffett stocks to buy and hold for the next 10 years.

**1. Amazon (AMZN)**

Although Amazon isn't one of Buffett's largest positions, it has the potential to be one of his biggest winners over the next decade. While Amazon has historically focused on reinvesting profits to fuel growth, the company's executives are now working hard to boost profitability. This shift, coupled with the significant potential of artificial intelligence (AI), makes Amazon a stock worth considering.

As organizations build generative AI apps in the cloud, Amazon's Amazon Web Services (AWS) platform stands to benefit tremendously. The company's e-commerce and advertising businesses should also become more profitable by leveraging AI. Additionally, Amazon's willingness to expand into new arenas, such as selling cars online, demonstrates its commitment to future growth.

**2. Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A, BRK.B)**

Berkshire Hathaway is a holding company with more than 60 subsidiaries spanning multiple industries. This diversification provides investors with exposure to a wide range of sectors and makes Berkshire Hathaway comparable to an exchange-traded fund (ETF). With core businesses including insurance and energy, Berkshire Hathaway is poised for long-term success.

Concerns about Buffett's health and how it could impact the stock are valid. However, the company has highly capable executives and investment managers who are involved in running the company. This mitigates the risk associated with Buffett's potential health issues.

**3. Mastercard (MA)**

Mastercard is an attractive stock for long-term investors due to its strong business moats, including network effects, economies of scale, and a well-established brand. As e-commerce continues to grow and digital payments become more pervasive, Mastercard is well-positioned to benefit from these trends.

Additionally, the expansion of middle classes in emerging markets creates another growth opportunity for Mastercard. The increased adoption of digital payments and credit card use in these markets should boost the company's revenue and profitability.

It's important to note that while these stocks have strong potential for the long term, investors should conduct thorough research and consider their own investment objectives before making any decisions.
