## summary

# This company pays you monthly, and its stock has obliterated the S&P 500 for decades

*By [Your Name]*

Investing in stocks can be a lucrative way to grow your wealth, but not all stocks are created equal. While many investors aim to beat the market, it's not an easy feat. However, there are a few exceptional stocks that have consistently outperformed the S&P 500 over the years. One such stock is Realty Income (NYSE: O), a real estate investment trust (REIT) that pays its investors a monthly dividend.

Realty Income is a REIT that focuses on retail properties, renting to businesses such as gyms, convenience stores, and grocery stores. What makes this company unique is its monthly dividend payment structure, which provides investors with a steady stream of income.

However, Realty Income's stock price has declined by 26% from its high. The primary reason for this decline is the impact of higher interest rates, which have made it more expensive for REITs to fund their growth. Additionally, investors have been drawn to other income-generating options, such as Treasury bonds, which offer competitive yields in a rising interest rate environment.

Despite these challenges, there are several reasons why investors should consider buying Realty Income stock. First, the company has a long history of creating substantial wealth for shareholders. Over its lifetime, the stock has returned approximately 5,000%, outpacing the S&P 500 by nearly three-to-one. This impressive performance is due to Realty Income's consistent growth in funds from operations (FFO), a metric that REITs report instead of earnings.

Realty Income also presents an attractive valuation opportunity. With management's expected 2023 FFO per share of $4, the stock trades at an earnings multiple of 15. While the stock has rebounded from its 52-week low of $45, it still offers potential for investors who are willing to hold shares for the long term and reinvest the dividends.

One of the key selling points of Realty Income is its ability to endure adversity and deliver consistent returns. The company has raised its dividend for 30 consecutive years, demonstrating its ability to navigate through recessions, market crashes, and even the recent COVID-19 pandemic. This track record provides investors with confidence in Realty Income's management and their ability to continue growing the business.

It's important to remember that no stock should be held forever without continually earning investors' trust. However, Realty Income has proven itself to be a resilient and dependable investment option. As long as the company continues to deliver on its promises and navigate challenges successfully, it could be a stock worth adding to your portfolio.

In conclusion, Realty Income is a monthly dividend-paying stock that has consistently outperformed the S&P 500 over the years. Despite recent challenges, the company's track record of generating wealth for investors and its ability to navigate adversity make it an intriguing investment option. As always, it's essential for investors to conduct their own research and carefully consider their investment goals before making any decisions.
