# This Dividend Stock is One of the Most Profitable Companies in the World

*By Parkev Tatevosian, CFA â€“ January 13, 2024*

Mastercard (NYSE: MA) is a dividend stock that stands out as one of the most profitable companies in the world. Fool.com contributor Parkev Tatevosian explains why this dividend stock is an excellent match for passive income investors.

With a market capitalization of $402 billion, Mastercard has firmly established itself as a leader in the payments industry. The company provides electronic payment solutions to individuals, businesses, and governments in over 210 countries. Mastercard's strong global presence and network make it an attractive investment option.

One of the key reasons why Mastercard is a great dividend stock is its consistent and growing profitability. The company's global network and technology have allowed it to generate substantial revenue and profits consistently. This stability gives investors confidence in the company's ability to continue paying and potentially increasing dividends over time.

Mastercard's financial performance has been impressive. In the third quarter of 2023, the company reported revenue of $5.1 billion, representing a 21% year-over-year increase. Net income for the same period was $2.6 billion, up 30% compared to the previous year. Mastercard's strong financial results are a testament to its ability to capitalize on the growing trend of digital payments and the increasing adoption of its services worldwide.

The company's dividend track record is also noteworthy. Mastercard has consistently paid and increased its dividends over the years. As of January 12, 2024, the stock offered a dividend yield of approximately 0.48%. While this might seem low compared to some other dividend stocks, investors should consider the company's impressive growth potential and the potential for future dividend increases.

Investing in dividend stocks can be an attractive option for passive income investors. These stocks provide a regular income stream through dividends, which can be reinvested or used to supplement other income sources. Mastercard's stability, profitability, and solid dividend track record make it an excellent choice for investors seeking passive income.

It's important to note that investing in any stock carries some level of risk. Investors should carefully consider their financial goals, risk tolerance, and conduct thorough research before making any investment decisions.
