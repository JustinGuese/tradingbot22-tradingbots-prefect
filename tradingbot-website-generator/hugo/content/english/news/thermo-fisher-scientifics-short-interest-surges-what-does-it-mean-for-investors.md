## summary

# Thermo Fisher Scientific's Short Interest Rises 15.38%

Thermo Fisher Scientific, a leading scientific research company, has seen a significant increase in its short percent of float, according to its latest report. The company reported that its short percent of float has risen by 15.38% since its last report. Currently, there are 2.91 million shares sold short, which represents 0.75% of all regular shares available for trading.

Short interest refers to the number of shares that have been sold short but have not yet been covered or closed out. Short selling is a trading strategy where traders sell shares they do not own, with the expectation that the price will fall. Traders profit from short selling if the stock price declines, but they incur losses if it rises.

Monitoring short interest is important as it can serve as an indicator of market sentiment towards a particular stock. An increase in short interest suggests that investors have become more bearish, while a decrease indicates a more bullish sentiment.

It is essential to note that the rise in short interest does not necessarily mean that Thermo Fisher Scientific's stock will decline in the near term. However, traders should be aware that more shares are being shorted, which could impact the stock's performance.

When comparing Thermo Fisher Scientific's short interest to its peers, the company has less short interest than most of its peers. According to Benzinga Pro, the peer group average for short interest as a percentage of float is 6.01%. This indicates that Thermo Fisher Scientific is relatively less targeted by short sellers compared to its industry counterparts.

Increasing short interest can actually be seen as a bullish sign for a stock in some cases. Benzinga Money has an informative post on how investors can profit from increasing short interest.
