# Tiger Woods and Nike Officially Part Ways After 27 Years

Tiger Woods and Nike have officially ended their 27-year partnership, the legendary golfer announced in a statement on X. This marks the conclusion of a fruitful and iconic relationship that helped elevate Nike Golf into a major brand.

In his statement, Woods expressed his gratitude to Nike for the incredible moments and memories they shared over the years. He thanked Nike's founder, Phil Knight, as well as the company's employees and the amazing athletes he had the privilege of working with.

While Woods hinted at more news to come in the following days, he assured fans that there would be another chapter in his career. Speculations are now swirling about his next move and potential partnerships, with some suggesting a future in Los Angeles.

Woods, who became the most iconic name in golf history, dominated the sport in the late 1990s and early 2000s, winning major tournaments in spectacular fashion. Sporting the iconic red Nike polo on Sundays, Woods amassed an impressive 15 major championship victories, just three shy of Jack Nicklaus' record. He also shares the record for the most wins in PGA Tour events with 82.

However, Woods' career trajectory faced setbacks following a devastating car crash in Los Angeles. His appearances in tournaments have been sporadic, and his last major win was at the 2019 Masters. Nevertheless, his recent participation in the PNC Championship and the Hero World Challenge sparked hope for his return to the golf scene, potentially at the upcoming Augusta tournament in the spring.

Fans and golf enthusiasts will eagerly await the next chapter in Tiger Woods' career as he explores new opportunities beyond his long-standing partnership with Nike.
