# Tiger Woods Ends 27-Year Partnership with Nike

**January 8, 2024**

Tiger Woods, one of the most successful golfers in history, is parting ways with Nike after a 27-year partnership. This decision marks a significant business move for the athlete, with the deal with Nike accounting for more than a quarter of Woods' estimated $1.8 billion in career pretax earnings.

The partnership between Woods and Nike began in 1996, just after he turned pro. Over the years, the contract grew in value as Woods achieved tremendous success in the sport, winning 15 majors and becoming the most famous golfer of his generation. At its peak, Woods earned more than $30 million annually from Nike, making it a key contributor to his annual income.

Nike, in a statement, expressed gratitude for being a part of Woods' journey and acknowledged his role in redefining the sport of golf. However, the future of Nike's golf division is uncertain, with rumors swirling that the company might pull out of golf entirely.

As for Woods, his next move remains unclear. He may consider expanding his deal with his club sponsor, TaylorMade, or exploring options with a sports apparel upstart. However, it has been confirmed that Woods will be participating in the Genesis Invitational, a PGA Tour event he hosts in Southern California in February.

While Woods' departure from Nike marks the end of a long-standing partnership, it opens up new possibilities for the golfer. As he embarks on the next chapter of his career, fans and industry experts eagerly await to see where Woods will go next.
