# Smart Ways to Invest Your Money This Year

*Published on January 13, 2024, by Jeff Reeves*

Following a red-hot run for the equities market, many investors are now seeking smart ways to invest their money in 2024. The S&P 500 index, which tracks the largest U.S. stocks, experienced a total return of approximately 26% in 2023. However, it is important to remember that past performance is not indicative of future returns. Before making any investments, it is crucial to consider the current economic environment and personal risk tolerance. Fortunately, there are several smart investment strategies that can help improve your personal finances.

One of the safest investment options in terms of fixed returns is a Certificate of Deposit (CD) or high-yield savings account. With the recent increase in interest rates, CDs offer nearly guaranteed returns. While the interest rates may not be as high as other investment vehicles, CDs can serve as a disciplined way to set aside money while earning higher interest rates on your balances. It's important to balance this investment with readily accessible savings for emergencies.

Bond funds are another low-risk investment option that provides liquidity. Bonds involve lending money to governments or corporations in exchange for repayment with interest. Instead of individually researching bonds, many investors prefer bond funds, such as traditional mutual funds or bond Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs). These options offer diversification and a structured approach to investing, allowing investors to easily buy and sell bonds. The Vanguard Total Bond Market ETF (BND) is the largest bond fund, offering investors exposure to a wide array of bonds, including corporate debt, U.S. Treasury bonds, and mortgage-backed securities. Currently, BND yields around 4.3%.

For investors seeking growth and higher potential returns, stocks are a more aggressive option. Stocks are investments in publicly traded companies that have the potential to appreciate in value. However, unlike CDs or bonds, stocks do not offer fixed rates of return. It's important to note that stocks carry higher risks, and carefully assessing your goals and risk tolerance is crucial. One popular way to invest in stocks is through ETFs or mutual funds. The SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) is the largest and most popular vehicle, providing exposure to the 500 largest U.S. stocks, including well-known companies like Apple. 

While investing is not without risks, these smart investment strategies can help individuals make the most of their money in 2024. It's essential to conduct thorough research, consider personal financial goals and risk tolerance, and consult with a financial advisor if needed. Investing a modest amount of cash can potentially yield significant financial gains.
