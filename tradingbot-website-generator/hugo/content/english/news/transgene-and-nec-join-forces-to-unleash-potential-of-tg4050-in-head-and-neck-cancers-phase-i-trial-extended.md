## summary

Transgene, a biotech company that develops immunotherapies for cancer treatment, and NEC Corporation, a leader in IT and AI technologies, have announced an extension of their collaboration to continue the clinical development of their neoantigen cancer vaccine, TG4050. The companies plan to start an extension of the Phase I trial into a Phase I/II study in 2024, focusing on head and neck cancers. TG4050 is currently being evaluated as a single agent in the adjuvant treatment of HPV-negative head and neck cancers. 

The decision to extend the trial follows promising data obtained in the Phase I trial, showing efficacy and induction of specific T-cell responses. The Phase I/II extension aims to generate comprehensive immunological and clinical data to further demonstrate the potential of TG4050. Transgene and NEC expect to present additional data from the Phase I trial in the first half of 2024.

TG4050 is based on Transgene's viral vector-based myvac platform and utilizes NEC's AI capabilities for the identification and prediction of immunogenic neoantigens. The combination of the powerful viral vector and sophisticated neoantigen selection tool holds promise for addressing major medical needs in the adjuvant treatment of solid tumors.

Alessandro Riva, Chairman and CEO of Transgene, expressed his pleasure in extending the collaboration with NEC and emphasized the potential of TG4050. He highlighted the promising Phase I data, which showed all evaluable patients treated with TG4050 developed a specific immune response and remained disease-free. Riva believes TG4050 has the potential to prevent relapse in patients after adjuvant chemoradiotherapy, where there is currently no approved treatment.

Masamitsu Kitase, Head of Healthcare and Life Sciences Division at NEC Corporation, expressed excitement about collaborating further on TG4050. He emphasized the positive results from the Phase I study and the role of NEC's AI and machine learning models in predicting clinically meaningful neoantigens.

TG4050 is being evaluated in a Phase I clinical trial for HPV-negative head and neck cancers. The trial is assessing the safety, feasibility, and biological activity of the therapeutic vaccine. Initial data presented at AACR 2023 and ASCO 2023 showed encouraging results.

Transgene is focused on designing targeted immunotherapies for cancer treatment using viral vector technology. Their myvac platform allows for the development of individualized immunotherapies tailored to each patient. TG4050 is the first myvac-derived product being evaluated in clinical trials.

NEC Corporation is a leader in IT and network technologies, promoting the integration of technology to create a brighter world. Their neoantigen prediction system utilizes AI and machine learning to discover candidate neoantigen targets and strengthen personalized cancer immunotherapy.

The collaboration between Transgene and NEC highlights the potential of TG4050 as a promising immunotherapy for the adjuvant treatment of head and neck cancers. Continued development and evaluation of TG4050 will contribute valuable clinical data and potentially provide a new treatment option for patients.
