# History Says the Nasdaq Could Soar in 2024: Here's What I Would Buy Before Then

*By Stefon Walters â€“ Jan 13, 2024 at 10:45AM*

The Nasdaq-100 tracks the 100 largest non-financial companies trading on the Nasdaq stock exchange. The "Magnificent Seven" stocks account for around 43% of the Invesco QQQ ETF. The Invesco QQQ ETF has outperformed the S&P 500 since its inception.

Going with a Nasdaq-100 ETF can give investors broad exposure to the Nasdaq and hedge risks. Last year was great for the Nasdaq Composite, surging 43% to lead all major indexes. This was a notable turnaround after the index lost a third of its value in 2022 amid rising inflation and recession fears.

One thing about history is that it often repeats itself, including in the stock market. If that continues to be the case, investors should be encouraged heading into 2024. The last few times the Nasdaq Composite finished a year in the negative (2002, 2008, 2011, and 2018), it bounced back with at least two straight positive years.

| Year of Decline | Decline Percentage | Gains One Year After Decline | Gains Two Years After Decline |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2008 | (40.5%) | 43.9% | 16.9% |
| 2011 | (1.8%) | 15.9% | 38.3% |
| 2018 | (3.9%) | 35.2% | 43.6% |
| 2022 | (33.1%) | 43.4% | TBD |

There's no way to predict market movements, and past results don't guarantee future performance, but many of the catalysts responsible for the Nasdaq's 2023 bounceback -- such as AI and cloud computing -- are still relatively early in what they can become and should carry momentum through the year. To get ahead of the game, here's an exchange-traded fund (ETF) I'd buy.

## Let top tech companies lead the way for you

The Nasdaq-100 is a subset index of the Nasdaq Composite that tracks the 100 largest non-financial companies trading on the Nasdaq Stock Market. The Invesco QQQ ETF (QQQ 0.05%) is an ETF that mirrors the Nasdaq-100 and is the second-most traded ETF on the U.S. stock market.

Much of the appeal of the Invesco QQQ ETF is its composition. Below are its top five holdings and how much of the ETF they account for (as of Jan. 5, 2024):

- Apple: 8.95%
- Microsoft: 8.68%
- Amazon: 4.77%
- Broadcom: 4.02%
- Meta Platforms: 3.95%

The Invesco QQQ ETF is undoubtedly tech-dominant (57% of the fund), but the companies cover a lot of areas within the tech sector. They cover consumer electronics (Apple), social media (Meta Platforms), software and services (Adobe, Alphabet, Intuit), semiconductors (Advanced
