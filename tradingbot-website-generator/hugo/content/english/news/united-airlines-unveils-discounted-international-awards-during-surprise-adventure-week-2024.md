# United Teases Discounted International Awards During Surprise Adventure Week

Looking for a deal on mileage awards? Traveling opportunistically and being flexible on your destination is often the best way to find bargain prices—and United Airlines is giving you a heads up on where to search during its "Surprise Adventure Week" from January 8-12, 2024.

During this week, United Airlines will announce a sale to a single destination each day. Travelers who book quickly can score awards for 50,000 miles round trip (plus taxes and fees). The booking period is short, but eligible travel may take place between January 10 and March 20, 2024. Flights must start in the continental U.S. and end at the designated destination, with all segments operated by United Airlines or its subsidiaries.

Economy tickets are advertised at a flat price of 50,000 miles round trip, and one-way travel is not discounted. Premium classes are excluded from the promotion, and taxes and fees will vary by destination.

The destinations for each day of the Surprise Adventure Week have been announced so far: London, U.K. on January 8 and Paris, France on January 9. The destinations for January 10-12 are yet to be announced.

To book these discounted awards, travelers can search and book directly on United Airlines' website. It's important to note that availability is widespread from most airports in the lower 48, and there is no bait and switch with limited dates or capacity. Families can also find availability for their entire group.

If you don't have enough United miles, you can consider transferring credit card miles to your United MileagePlus account. Chase Ultimate Rewards® transfer to United Airlines at a 1:1 ratio, with most transfers completed instantly. Alternatively, you can buy miles to top off your account, although this is generally an expensive option.

Overall, United's Surprise Adventure Week is a fun way to find discounted mileage awards for international travel. However, travelers must act quickly as each destination is only on sale for 24 hours, and travel must be completed by March 20, 2024.
