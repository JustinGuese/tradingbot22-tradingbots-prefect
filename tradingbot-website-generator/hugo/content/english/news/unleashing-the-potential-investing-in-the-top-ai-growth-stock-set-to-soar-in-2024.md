# This AI Category Leader Could be One of the Market's Biggest Winners in 2024 and Beyond

Artificial intelligence (AI) is poised to revolutionize various industries and bring about significant advancements in productivity and healthcare. However, it also presents new threats, particularly in the realm of cybersecurity. AI-powered cyberattacks have the potential to be highly disruptive and destabilizing. In the face of increasing threats, cybersecurity companies have an opportunity to emerge as long-term winners. One such company is CrowdStrike (NASDAQ: CRWD), a leading player in the AI-powered cybersecurity space.

CrowdStrike's flagship product, the Falcon platform, leverages AI and machine learning to protect networks from hardware device attacks. The cloud-based platform offers best-in-class protection and has been witnessing a surge in demand. Not only is CrowdStrike adding new customers, but it is also experiencing increased spending from existing customers. Currently, 63% of customers use five or more of the company's more than two dozen modules. This increased adoption and spending highlight the platform's high performance and value.

In the third quarter, CrowdStrike's sales rose by 35% year over year to reach $786 million, while non-GAAP net income more than doubled to $199.2 million. The company's investment in research and development (R&D) has also been substantial, with R&D spending increasing by 38% annually in the last three reported quarters to reach $410 million. This ongoing investment demonstrates CrowdStrike's commitment to long-term growth and competitive positioning.

When it comes to valuation, CrowdStrike appears attractively valued despite trading at 93 times this year's expected earnings. With strong growth, impressive margins, and a favorable long-term demand outlook, the stock has the potential to deliver significant returns for long-term investors.

The need for high-performance cybersecurity services will only continue to grow, giving CrowdStrike an advantage as a leader in AI-enhanced protections. As demand for cybersecurity solutions increases and industry consolidation trends favor top players, CrowdStrike is well-positioned to benefit.

In conclusion, for investors looking to capitalize on the intersection of AI and cybersecurity trends, CrowdStrike stock stands out as a potential long-term winner. With its market leadership, strong financial performance, and commitment to innovation, CrowdStrike has the makings of one of the market's biggest winners in 2024 and beyond.
