# The SEC's Decision Opens Up 401(k)s and IRAs to Investing in Bitcoin

*[Published: Jan. 13, 2024 at 7:55 a.m. ET](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/these-mutual-fund-and-etf-investing-tips-can-help-you-find-what-your-portfolio-needs-now-2024-01-13)*

The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has made a groundbreaking decision that could have a significant impact on retirement investing. The SEC has opened up 401(k)s and IRAs to investing in bitcoin through the use of bitcoin ETFs. This decision marks a major milestone in the acceptance of cryptocurrencies as legitimate investment assets.

Bitcoin ETFs have been in the spotlight recently, with the launch of the first-ever spot bitcoin ETFs. These new ETFs track the price of bitcoin and allow investors to gain exposure to the cryptocurrency without directly owning it. The SEC's decision opens the door for these bitcoin ETFs to be included in retirement portfolios, giving individuals the opportunity to invest in bitcoin in a tax-advantaged account.

The debut of first-of-a-kind ETFs, such as the spot bitcoin ETFs, has historically yielded valuable insights for investors. By looking at the previous launches of innovative ETFs, investors can learn important lessons and make informed decisions about their investments. The launch of bitcoin ETFs is no exception, and investors should pay close attention to how these products perform in the market.

Vanguard's recent decision to shun bitcoin ETFs has triggered a backlash from customers. Some of these customers are moving their investments to crypto-friendly competitors like Fidelity, which provides investment options for bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Vanguard's decision highlights the ongoing debate surrounding the inclusion of cryptocurrencies in traditional investment portfolios.

While bitcoin ETFs are making waves in the investment world, there is speculation about which cryptocurrency will be the next to follow suit. BlackRock's Larry Fink expressed his interest in an ether ETF, suggesting that he sees value in the second-largest cryptocurrency. If an ether ETF is launched, it could further expand the options for investors looking to enter the crypto market through regulated investment vehicles.

Investors who are interested in adding bitcoin ETFs to their retirement portfolios should be mindful of the difference between trading and investing. It's essential to understand the risks and potential rewards of investing in bitcoin and to approach it as a long-term investment rather than a short-term trade. Consulting with a financial advisor can help individuals make informed decisions about including bitcoin ETFs in their retirement accounts.

As the new year begins, investors are keeping a close eye on market trends and making predictions for the financial markets in 2024. Hedge-fund manager Cody Willard shared 10 predictions for stocks, crypto, AI, gold, and bonds. These predictions provide valuable insights into the potential opportunities and challenges that lie ahead for investors.

Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) funds faced criticism in recent times. However, some funds still managed to outperform the market. These funds achieved success by emphasizing growth over value and focusing on companies that align with ESG principles. Despite the criticism, ESG funds have demonstrated their ability to generate positive returns while adhering to sustainable investing practices.

The start of the year saw stocks losing money over the first five trading days, leading to speculation about the market's performance in 2024. It's important to note that the full-year performance of the U.S. market is not solely determined by the early trading days. Investors should be cautious about drawing conclusions based on short-term fluctuations and consider the broader market trends and economic conditions.

In 2023, mutual funds struggled to beat benchmarks as stocks climbed. The narrow market breadth presented a challenging environment for active fund managers. However, a broadening rally in the market could potentially provide new opportunities for mutual funds to outperform their benchmarks in 2024. Investors should closely monitor market conditions and the performance of their mutual fund investments.

The $6 trillion pile of cash in money-market funds has been a topic of discussion for many market observers. There has been speculation about whether this cash will flow into the stock market, driving further gains. However, some experts argue that the notion of "cash on the sidelines" being bullish for stocks is merely propaganda. It remains to be seen how this large cash reserve will impact future market movements.

The SEC's decision to allow bitcoin ETFs in retirement accounts marks a significant shift in the investment landscape. It opens up new opportunities for individuals to include cryptocurrencies in their retirement portfolios, providing potential exposure to the volatile but potentially rewarding asset class. It is important for investors to carefully consider the risks and rewards associated with investing in bitcoin and to seek professional advice before making any investment decisions.
