## summary

# The Age of AI has begun, and one company is best positioned for it

Artificial intelligence (AI) stocks have been the stars of the market in 2023, with investors reaping significant gains from companies like Nvidia, Microsoft, and Amazon. However, not every AI-related stock saw the same level of success. One company that entered the AI industry later in the year is DigitalOcean, and it might just be the best-positioned company for the Age of AI.

DigitalOcean, a provider of cloud services, specializes in serving small and mid-size businesses (SMBs). While giants like Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud dominate the cloud market, DigitalOcean's tailored offering for SMBs sets it apart. The company's pricing is cheap and transparent, its service is highly personalized, and it provides educational materials to help customers maximize their cloud experience.

The company's entry into AI is significant. AI applications require advanced computing power, which can be costly and complex to implement. By bringing that power to small businesses, DigitalOcean aims to unlock tremendous value and help SMBs harness the power of AI. Last year, DigitalOcean acquired Paperspace for $111 million, a move that gives the company access to over 500,000 customers and a range of GPUs designed for AI workloads.

A recent survey by DigitalOcean found that 43% of developers and SMBs currently use AI and machine learning, with 78% planning to increase their usage this year. Furthermore, research by Ark Investment Management suggests that advancements in hardware and software will significantly reduce the cost of training AI models, leading to increased adoption. Ark estimates that businesses could invest up to $41 trillion in AI by 2030, adding $200 trillion to the global economy.

DigitalOcean's financial performance has been solid, with expected revenue of $690 million for 2023, representing nearly 20% growth compared to the previous year. While weaker economic conditions have affected the start-up space, where many of DigitalOcean's customers are funded by investors, the company's focus on profitability has led to positive net income.

Investors might view the current price of DigitalOcean stock as an attractive opportunity. Trading at a discount, the stock offers potential for outsized gains in the upcoming years as the integration of Paperspace progresses and the adoption of AI accelerates. Investors can seize the opportunity to position themselves in the forefront of the AI revolution with DigitalOcean.
