## summary

# It's No Secret That Chevron Is Building a Potentially Monster Growth Engine

Chevron is investing billions of dollars into building a lower-carbon energy platform, which could pay big dividends for shareholders. The oil giant, known for raking in billions from fossil fuel production, believes that carbon-based energy will continue to fuel the global economy for years to come. However, it also recognizes the importance of lower-carbon energy in the future and is making significant investments to capitalize on this market.

Chevron is investing $10 billion through 2028 on lower-carbon projects, which includes reducing the carbon intensity of its traditional operations and expanding its new business lines. While these investments might seem small compared to its fossil fuel investments, they demonstrate Chevron's commitment to building a lower-carbon growth engine.

One area where Chevron is emerging as a leader is in the renewable fuels sector. The company has set a goal to grow its renewable fuel production capacity to 100,000 barrels per day by 2030. It recently acquired Renewable Energy Group (REG) in a $3.2 billion deal, which will contribute to achieving this target. Chevron expects the acquisition to be accretive to its earnings in the first year and enhance its free cash flow. Chevron will also invest in growing its renewable fuels platform in the coming years to take advantage of a market that could triple in size by 2030.

Chevron is also investing in hydrogen and carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) platforms. These markets have the potential for massive growth, with green hydrogen projected to exceed the worldwide LNG market by 2030 and become a $1.4 trillion annual global market by 2050. CCUS could reach a $4 trillion global market by 2050, according to Exxon. Chevron's investments in these markets could position it as a major player in the future and generate steady earnings and cash flow through long-term contracts.

Overall, Chevron's investments in building a lower-carbon energy platform make it an attractive energy stock for long-term investors. The company recognizes the future potential of lower-carbon energy and is positioning itself to capitalize on the opportunities in this emerging market. By diversifying its business and investing in renewable fuels, hydrogen, and CCUS, Chevron could create a potentially powerful growth engine that could benefit shareholders in the years ahead.
