## summary

# Kinder Morgan battled a couple of headwinds in 2023

Kinder Morgan, one of the largest pipeline companies in North America, faced some challenges in 2023 that caused its stock to underperform the broader market. While the company's high-yielding dividend provided some consolation, it significantly trailed the S&P 500's performance.

During 2023, Kinder Morgan's shares slipped 2.4%, while the S&P 500 gained 24.2%, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence. However, when factoring in the company's dividend, its total return for the year was 4.1%.

Several headwinds impacted Kinder Morgan's performance in 2023, including rising interest rates and lower oil prices. The company had anticipated that higher interest rates would negatively affect its distributable cash flow (DCF), which declined from $2.17 per share to $2.13 per share. Lower commodity prices, delayed RNG projects, and increased pipeline integrity expenses also contributed to a challenging year for the company.

Despite these headwinds, Kinder Morgan was able to make a significant acquisition in 2023. NextEra Energy Partners, an energy infrastructure operator, decided to sell its natural gas pipeline assets due to changing strategies. Kinder Morgan seized the opportunity and acquired STX Midstream from NextEra Energy Partners for approximately $1.8 billion. This deal is expected to have a positive impact on Kinder Morgan's growth rate and significantly expand its pipeline portfolio.

Looking ahead to 2024, Kinder Morgan expects a more favorable operating environment. The company anticipates a 5% increase in its DCF, driven by rate escalations and recently completed expansion projects. Additionally, the acquisition of STX Midstream is expected to further enhance the company's growth prospects. Kinder Morgan also aims to increase its dividend by approximately 2%, marking its seventh consecutive year of dividend growth.

Despite its underperformance in 2023, Kinder Morgan appears poised for a stronger performance in 2024. With headwinds subsiding and significant growth opportunities on the horizon, the company expects to deliver a double-digit total return this year. With a dividend yield of over 6% and earnings projected to grow by more than 5%, Kinder Morgan may be an attractive investment option for income-seeking investors.
