# Boeing Quality Control and Company Culture Under Fire After 737 Max Blowout

Transportation giant Boeing is facing intense scrutiny over its quality control process and company culture following a blowout incident on its 737 Max Flight 1282. Both United and Alaska airlines discovered loose bolts on Boeing 737 Max 9 jets after they were grounded, raising concerns about the company's quality control practices. This comes after previous issues with the 737 Max, suggesting a potential underlying problem.

Boeing's culture has reportedly shifted over the years, prioritizing financial considerations over engineering excellence since a merger in 1997. This shift has prompted concerns about the overall safety and quality of Boeing's aircraft. The latest blowout incident has led to calls for significant improvements in the company's quality control procedures.

The blowout on the Alaska Airlines plane resulted in a gaping hole in the fuselage, causing oxygen masks to deploy and personal belongings, including cellphones, to be sucked out of the aircraft. Thankfully, no serious injuries were reported as the plane landed safely 20 minutes after takeoff. However, if the incident had occurred at a higher altitude or further from an airport, the outcome could have been much worse.

In response to the blowout incident, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) grounded all Boeing 737 Max 9 planes with door plugs. United and Alaska Airlines have since discovered loose hardware on several aircraft. As a result, the FAA announced that all affected planes would remain grounded until they underwent thorough inspections, with an emphasis on safety over speed.

Further investigations by the National Transportation Safety Board found that four bolts holding the door plug in place were unaccounted for, raising questions about whether they were lost or never installed. Subsequently, the FAA announced "significant actions" to increase oversight of Boeing, including an audit of the 737 Max 9 production line and exploring the use of an independent third party to oversee inspections.

The blowout of the Alaska Airlines plane has reignited concerns about Boeing's safety record and its relationship with regulators. Airline executives, including Michael O'Leary, the CEO of Ryanair, and Tim Clark, the president of Emirates, have criticized Boeing's quality control and called for significant improvements.

The issues surrounding the 737 Max aircraft trace back to its grounding in 2019 after two crashes that claimed the lives of nearly 350 people. It was later revealed that the crashes were caused by design flaws and inadequate training for pilots regarding the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS). Subsequent investigations led to criminal charges against Boeing for conspiracy to defraud the FAA and a deferred-prosecution agreement that included a $2.5 billion penalty.

Critics argue that Boeing's culture began to shift after its merger with McDonnell Douglas in 1997, prioritizing financial considerations over engineering excellence. Former McDonnell Douglas CEO Harry Stonecipher, who later took on the same role at Boeing, emphasized a business-focused approach rather than one centered around engineering. This shift has led to concerns about corner-cutting and quality control problems within the company.

Boeing CEO Dave Calhoun has acknowledged the Alaska Airlines incident as a mistake and pledged to engineer solutions to prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future. However, skepticism remains as to whether the company can effectively address its cultural and operational challenges.

As investigations continue and scrutiny intensifies, Boeing faces significant pressure to address the issues with its quality control processes and company culture. The aviation industry, regulators, and passengers around the world are closely monitoring the actions taken by Boeing to ensure the safety and reliability of its aircraft.
