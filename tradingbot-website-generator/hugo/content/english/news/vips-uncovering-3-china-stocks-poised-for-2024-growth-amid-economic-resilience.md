# China's Economy Shows Resilience in 2023, Expected to Outperform Global Economy

China's economy is projected to have grown by approximately 5% or slightly higher in 2023, surpassing the performance of the global economy. Despite facing challenges and a slower pace compared to pre-COVID times, this growth demonstrates the resilience of the Chinese economy in the face of economic headwinds.

The Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson, Wang Wenbin, stated that China is expected to play a crucial role in driving global economic growth in 2024. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) Senior Resident Representative in China also predicts continued sound growth for the Chinese economy, accounting for one-third of global economic growth.

Analysts and institutions such as the Economist Intelligence Unit and the U.S. Center for Strategic and International Studies anticipate further strengthening of China's fundamentals in 2024. These predictions are based on strong exports in electric vehicle batteries, electronic products, and minerals, making several Chinese industries globally competitive.

The stable growth of the Chinese economy in 2023 can be attributed to policy support, rising consumption expectations, increased investment in manufacturing, and a recovering real estate market. The expanding consumption demand, rising investment in construction and manufacturing, and policy measures supporting the real estate industry are expected to have boosted the Chinese economy in the fiscal fourth quarter.

The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has upgraded China's GDP growth forecast for 2024 to 4.6%, up from the previous estimate of 4.2%. This revision is attributed to China's approval of a 1 trillion yuan ($137 billion) sovereign bond issue and measures implemented to support the economy.

Given the positive outlook for China's economy, investors may consider robust Chinese stocks with potential for gains in 2024. Three fundamentally sound Chinese stocks with promising prospects are Autohome Inc. (ATHM), Tuniu Corporation (TOUR), and Vipshop Holdings Limited (VIPS).

Tuniu Corporation (TOUR) is an online leisure travel company in China, providing packaged tours and other travel-related services. TOUR's gross profit margin and net income margin are significantly higher than the industry averages. The company has anticipated a substantial increase in net revenues for the fiscal fourth quarter in 2023, indicating strong growth.
