# Voltalia Exceeds Capacity Targets in Renewable Energy

Voltalia, an international player in renewable energies, has surpassed its capacity targets for total capacity and capacity in operation. The company, listed on Euronext Paris with ISIN code FR0011995588, initially set a target of 2.6 gigawatts in June 2019, which was later raised to 2.8 gigawatts in October 2023. However, Voltalia has now reached a total capacity of 2.85 gigawatts, marking a significant increase of 2.8 since June 2019.

In addition, the target for capacity in operation, initially set at 2.3 gigawatts in October 2023, has been exceeded, reaching 2.37 gigawatts. This represents a remarkable growth of 4.4 since June 2019, with a significant increase of 50.9% in 2023 alone.

Sébastien Clerc, CEO of Voltalia, expressed his satisfaction with the company's performance, stating, "We have exceeded by 10% the target of 2.6 gigawatts of total capacity that Voltalia had set itself for 2019, just before the Covid-19 pandemic, which nevertheless slowed down the granting of administrative authorizations and construction work. This performance is the fruit of the joint efforts of Voltalia's development, construction, maintenance, financing, and support specialists."

The capacity of power plants in operation experienced exceptional growth of 50.9% in 2023, increasing from 1,571 to 2,370 megawatts. The record volume of power stations commissioned in 2023 has significantly reduced the stock of power stations under construction from 1,022 megawatts at the end of 2022 to 480 megawatts at the end of 2023. Overall, the capacity of power plants in operation and under construction has seen an approximate 10% increase in 2023.

Solar technology, including both ground-mounted and rooftop installations, continues to be a major focus for Voltalia, accounting for 66% of the company's power plants in operation and under construction, compared to 60% at the end of 2022.

Throughout 2023, Voltalia commissioned a total of 795 megawatts of renewable energy capacity across various locations. This includes 80.3 megawatts in France, 50.6 megawatts in Portugal, 140 megawatts in Albania, and 359.4 megawatts in Brazil. Voltalia subsidiary Helexia also commissioned 164.8 megawatts of solar roofs and shading systems in Europe and Brazil.

Furthermore, Voltalia acquired an additional 96.2 megawatts of renewable energy capacity that will be operational by 2023. This includes the acquisition of 55% of the 60 megawatt Mosselbanken solar power plant in the Netherlands and the acquisition of a portfolio of agricultural solar roofs totaling 36.2 megawatts in France.

On the other hand, Voltalia sold 91.6 megawatts of renewable energy capacity in operation. This includes the sale of wind farms in France and Brazil, totaling 33.1 and 58.5 megawatts, respectively.

Looking ahead, Voltalia is set to announce its Q4 2023 turnover on January 31, 2024, after the market closes.
