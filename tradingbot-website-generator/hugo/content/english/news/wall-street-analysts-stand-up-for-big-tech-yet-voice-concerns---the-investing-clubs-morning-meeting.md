## summary

# Wall Street analysts defend this Big Tech name but express caution on banks

The CNBC Investing Club with Jim Cramer holds its "Morning Meeting" livestream every weekday at 10:20 a.m. ET. Here's a recap of Monday's key moments:

1. U.S. stocks were mixed on Monday as markets regrouped after last week's losses. The tech sector saw gains, with the Nasdaq shooting up over 1% after the opening bell. Notable winners in the group included Nvidia, which reached an all-time high early in the day. Amazon and Apple also experienced a bounce, pushing the Nasdaq higher. The S&P 500 saw modest gains while the Dow Jones Industrial Average edged slightly lower.

2. Wall Street analysts came to Apple's defense after a series of new year downgrades. Evercore ISI advised clients to buy the dip in a new research note, while Morgan Stanley analysts urged investors to stick with Apple due to its generative artificial intelligence efforts. The CNBC Investing Club also trimmed positions in its Magnificent Seven positions (excluding Tesla) and others last week, including a small sale of Apple, as the rally in the stock outweighed its position in the portfolio. However, the Club remains bullish on Apple, citing its solid fundamentals and growth prospects.

3. Big banks are set to report quarterly earnings this week, with Wells Fargo scheduled to release its fiscal results on Friday. Ahead of the release, Baird downgraded Wells Fargo from buy to neutral. Analysts noted that the risk/reward for the stock is more balanced after its recent run-up. The CNBC Investing Club shares a similar sentiment, preferring low expectations heading into the release.
