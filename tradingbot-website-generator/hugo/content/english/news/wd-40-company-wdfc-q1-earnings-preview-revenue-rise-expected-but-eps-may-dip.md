# WD-40 Company (WDFC) Earnings Watch and Analyzing Investor Strategies

WD-40 Company (WDFC) is set to reveal its first-quarter earnings tomorrow amid strategic business practices and innovative launches. Wall Street analysts expect the company to generate $134.40 million in revenue, indicating a 7.6% year-over-year rise. However, the company's EPS is expected to decline 2% from the prior year's period to $1.00.

Entering fiscal year 2024, WD-40 Company has deployed its Four-by-Four Strategic Framework, aligned with its core purpose and values. This framework focuses on four Must-Win Battles aimed at expanding net sales and four Strategic Enablers dedicated to achieving operational excellence.

Sara Hyzer, WDFC's vice president of finance and CFO, mentioned that the solid top-line growth in fiscal year 2023 reflects the company's resilient business model. Their net sales growth of 7% on a non-GAAP constant currency basis aligns with their long-term revenue target. The company continues to generate strong cash flow due to gross margin improvement, an asset-light business model, and disciplined capital allocation.

In addition to their strategic business practices, WD-40 Company unveiled the WD-40 Precision Pen last year, an innovative product designed to dispense the Original WD-40 Formula with unparalleled precision. This portable product taps into a niche market and has the potential to expand sales and market share, further strengthening the company's financial standing through strategic diversification.

Despite the recent 3% decline in shares over the past month, WD-40 Company has gained 43% over the past year, closing the last trading session at $232.48.

Financial aspects that could influence WD-40 Company's performance in the near term include the company's robust financials. In the fiscal 2023 fourth quarter, WDFC's net sales increased 7.7% year-over-year to $140.45 million. Gross profit grew 16.7% to $72.13 million, while net income and EPS rose 12.1% and 12% to $16.58 million and $1.21, respectively.

Over the past five years, WD-40 Company has shown moderate historical growth with a 5.6% CAGR in revenue and a 2.5% CAGR in EBITDA. However, its net income and EPS grew at marginal CAGRs over the same time frame.

When it comes to valuation, WD-40 Company carries a higher forward non-GAAP P/E, EV/Sales, and Price/Sales multiples compared to the industry averages. The stock's trailing-12-month gross profit margin, EBITDA margin, and levered FCF margin all outperform the industry averages.

Based on its POWR Ratings, WD-40 Company has an overall rating of C, which translates to Neutral. The stock has an A grade for Quality, reflecting its higher-than-industry profitability. However, it has a C grade for Growth, indicating its middling growth record, and a D grade for Value, reflecting its stretched valuation.

In conclusion, WD-40 Company is strategically positioned for sustained growth with its alignment of operations with core values, resilient business practices, and commitment to innovation. Its recent product launches, such as the WD-40 Precision Pen, demonstrate its dedication to meeting evolving market needs. However, investors should be cautious of the stock's higher valuation and consider waiting for a better entry point.

Comparing WDFC to its peers in the Home Improvement & Goods industry, the stock has an overall grade of C, while other stocks like Steelcase Inc. (SCS), Hamilton Beach Brands Holding Company (HBB), and Lifetime Brands, Inc. (LCUT) have an A rating.

Overall, WDFC's first-quarter earnings report will provide further insight into the company's financial performance and growth prospects.
